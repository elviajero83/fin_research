I'm delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath & Beyond's President and CEO. For many years, I've watched and admired this company as a competitor as well as a customer, reflecting on my own family's Back to College experiences. I'm excited for the opportunity to reconstruct, renovate and restore this iconic retailer. 
From a path of entry, Bed Bath & Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home, and I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers' lives. To do so, we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs. 
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago, I 
have been fully emerged in the business to assess our operations, our portfolio, our capabilities and our culture. My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath & Beyond has been affirmed. We have a highly recognizable envelope brand with passionate associates and customers. As a business, we have substantial scale with over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and in Canada, strong brand awareness amongst our customers and a business model that is supported by our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation. From day 1, I've received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change. During my store visits, I've witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win. I have also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened and responded directly to many customer concerns. 
Turning to our recent quarterly performance. We reported sales of $2.8 billion, an 8.3% comp sales decline and an adjusted loss of $0.38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share. The business was challenged by pre and post the Thanksgiving holiday period despite favorable results on a shipped basis during the 5-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. 
Let me be clear, these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the inherent need for change and strengthen our center priorities and purpose. We must respond to the challenges we face as a business, including pressured sales and profitability, and reconstruct a modern durable model for long-term profitable growth. The path to achieving our objective will not be linear, as evidenced by our third quarter results. But we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward. 
Now let me discuss our preliminary approach to a lead our company into the future. We'll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months, but today, I want to share some high-level insights into where we are heading. 
First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity. Let's start with some data here. Based on the results of a recent brand health tracker study and NPD consumer tracking data, Bed Bath & Beyond is #1 in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and its strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath. Overall, 79% of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand, and 75% of customers want to buy for our mat top category such as home textiles and house wares. This data demonstrates that Bed Bath & Beyond is still a beloved, well-known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a $51 billion U.S. market for the home-related categories we offer. We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share, to build stronger authority and performance. 
The data also speaks to our challenges, including a lack of clarity wrapped purpose and value and a softer connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories. In addition, we know in our industry is that 80% of traffic is influenced by a digital touch point, reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to basically improve our digital platform. There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home [indiscernible] for mass retailers; new competition from direct consumer brands; increased customer expectations across store, digital and delivery experiences; and the reality that the next-generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first. As such, we'll be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, including quickly evolving our strong performing reserve online, pick up in-store offering to a full Buy Online, Pick up In-Store or BOPUS model during the first half of fiscal 2020. 
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination. In doing so, we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers. Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition, one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels, customer segments, demographics and occasions. As such, we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data-driven services, which will enable us to more clearly review pricing, share and white space opportunities. Later this year, building upon this partnership, we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies. 
Regarding our go-forward strategy, we'll be grounded in the following 5 pillars: first, our product. We will refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath & Beyond and create energy through differentiation and curation. Second, our price. We'll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice and opening price points, relevant owned brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers. Third is our promise. We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting, engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value. Fourth is our place. We will accelerate and optimize connecting with, inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs. And lastly but critically important is our people. We'll create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts, retains and develops high-performance teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results. With these 5 pillars as our guide, we're embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness, adding a new course for our company. We look forward to sharing more details on these 5 strategic pillars and expectations for our future performance over the next few months. We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020, and we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans. 
In the meantime, our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near-term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth. We've been reviewing and optimizing the company's asset base, including the portfolio of retail banners as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest. We've been reviewing and resetting the cost structure modernizing for growth and refining our organization, which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG&A, including reducing overhead, improving sourcing, increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain. We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals. 
While top line still remains challenged, we've made tangible progress on many of these priorities. One action we've taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction, which generated net proceeds of over $250 million. This deal includes commercial space, including retail stores, a distribution facility and our corporate office in New Jersey, which will be continued to be occupied under the long-term leases. This activity marks the first step towards unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth, financial stability and shareholder value. 
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation, the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash-generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the company's core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce the company's outstanding debt or some combination of these. While we cannot find any specifics at this time, we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and work through the process with our outside advisers. 
In connection with this process, the company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate. Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course. 
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model, we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently, effectively. A rethink of the company's leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath & Beyond forward. Last month, I announced extensive changes to our leadership team, including the departure of 6 senior members. We'll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas but also the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision-making to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath & Beyond's authority in the home space. Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new innovative leaders of change will help us to anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs. During this period of transition, I am grateful to our leaders, who have stepped up for 5 key interim leadership in merchandising, digital, marketing, own brands and legal. I've buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided. I'll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together. 
In connection with the leadership announcement, I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already. The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high, and I'm confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions. 
In other activity, as part of our strategic focus, we've been further evaluating our product assortment by taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of own brands, balanced with a powerful arsenal of national brands. More to come on this soon. 
These are among the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company, one in which we work together to build a better business every day in a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home. With respect to our sales stabilization efforts, we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period, benefiting from all our stores being open on Thanksgiving day this year, new promotional activities and new pricing models. Comparing these 5 days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, 2019 versus 2018, comp sales actually increased by 7.1%, supported by growth in physical stores at over 5% and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13%. These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently, we can create meaningful positive outcomes. While strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred, we will be sharpening our value to quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new ones. 
As I said earlier, our third quarter results were unsatisfactory. To some extent, our performance was impacted by self-inflicted issues such as poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPUS, which I do know can be rectified going forward. In the near term, we will be focus on these issues in our operating model. And while improved performance will not be linear, we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently. 
In short, my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well positioned for long-term success. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. I truly believe this is 1 of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country, and I'm excited about the future of our business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financial. And then afterwards, I will make some closing remarks. Robyn?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43
72944058,646946776,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1888001,7,4,2020-01-08 23:09:55,3612,73931713,3,2,363007,"Thank you, Mark. Let's start with a review of our GAAP results. We reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.31 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.18 in the prior year period, which included a benefit of $0.16 from a gain on the sale of a building. Our reported net loss this quarter include a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share for special items, which include a favorable adjustment of $24 million to the company's previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns. That was partially offset by a noncash charge of $12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets. On an adjusted basis, our non-GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.38. 
To better represent the year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019, my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge as well as last year's gain from the building sale. As a reminder, our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30 and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving, while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1 and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week. 
Net sales in the quarter were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8.3% and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined in the high single-digit percentage range, while comp sales from our digital channels declined in the mid single-digit percentage range. 
Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, there was 1 less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods, our comp sales declined only 3.6%, with a decline in store sales of 6.5% and  growth in digital sales of 9.4%. 
During a like-for-like comparable period covering the 5 days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, our performance on comp sales growth of 7.1%, including growth in stores of over 5% and digital growth in excess of 13%. Despite the calendar shift, our business remains challenged with some self-inflicted issues, including poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options, and we are working to address these issues. 
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers, we executed a rapid refresh, 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout. We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period, including special in-store and online sales events and the launch of our first-ever national Black Friday advertising campaign. Overall, these are positive steps, but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins. 
Moving now to the gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.3% of net sales as compared to 33.1% in the third quarter of last year. This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin, driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct-to-customer shipping expense. 
Our BEYOND+ membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1.4 million members. While the BEYOND+ customer spends more and visits more often, the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin, including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which is similar to the prior year impact. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $931.8 million or 33.8% of net sales as compared to $982.5 million or 32.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This $51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure, including lower payroll and payroll-related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization efforts, partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, the 140 basis point increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, on a lower sales base as well as from higher advertising expenses. 
On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 20.6% and includes $2.8 million of net after-tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $920 million in cash and investments. Retail inventories of $2.7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10% or $289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns. This 10% reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9%. 
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier. As we disclosed last quarter, we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near-term priority to review and optimize our asset base. This included the removal of approximately $350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday. In conjunction with this decision, we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of $194 million in the second quarter. We have subsequently refined our plan, and as a result, we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned. And therefore, we recorded a $24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter. This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures. 
Moving to Capex. Our capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $188 million, with nearly 50% related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx was primarily related to investments in stores, including V models and new store openings. 
During the third quarter, we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened 4 stores. We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores, including about 20 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We had previously planned to close 60 total stores, including about 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We have decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell-through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative. We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores, including about 2 Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019. 
Regarding share repurchase activity. We had a low level of engagement in the market, repurchasing $1.2 million or 87,000 shares during the quarter. And as Mark stated earlier, our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on April 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020. 
Similar to our third quarter results, we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Considering these headwinds and Mark's ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go-forward strategic plan as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance. 
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a few additional pieces of information. First, our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pretax earnings will include the following items: approximately $11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately $33 million of a loss related to the sale leaseback transaction. Second, our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately $275 million to $300 million compared to our previous estimate of between $350 million to $375 million. This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects. And finally, in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transactions, we will incur annual incremental pretax net occupancy cost of $11 million, which began with the closing of the transaction in late December. Our balance sheet will include roughly $190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction. The transaction generated net proceeds of more than $250 million and included about 2.1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations, 1 distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey. And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years.

It is clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against emerging plan and clear goals. I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results, we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively. The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision. 
So today, I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going. We're experiencing short-term pain, some of which has been self-inflicted. We are making bold and broad-based changes to modernize our business. We have a solid balance sheet. We will have a relentless focus on our customer. We'll act as a true omnichannel retailer. We will be agile and take a measured approach, and as such, these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable durable business model. 
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures, different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery. Through the lens of these experiences, I can see our company's fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It's this perspective that is helping me to look objectively at the business and make bulk pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore Bed Bath & Beyond. We have plenty of options, a healthy balance sheet, as I said, to get to work and accomplish our goals. 
As I said before, our path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results. But we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward. 
In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Our entire team of more than 60,000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath & Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution. We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy, and we'll share these plans with you over the coming months. We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath & Beyond to deliver long-term sustainable growth.

Thanks, Curt. So in terms of the time frame, again, we're still in the process of evaluation, and I want to be really clear here, continuing to accelerate the existing transformation work that was put in place which was really solid. And we've been able to double down on that since becoming on board and just looking to get clarity on our priorities, our investments and our Capex. We still have a few balls in the air there that we're looking to solidify so we can help prioritize and build that plan. That's what I'm sharing that I'll come back in the spring to be really clear on our 2020 plan and the pagination of those goals. So it's more work to be done but work in flight. So stay tuned on that. So the time line and the operating model will be commensurate with that. But there's some individual efforts that are already taking shape, and we see ourselves doubling down on those. To date, they're mostly focused on operational strength and excellence and reconciliation.

So let's start with couponing. So I think what -- the key was that comes to mind here is really balanced. So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA, and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with. But we do see that there's an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer. And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they're searching online, which is a primary vehicle for research. So really rebalancing open price points, price right daily as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward. We're already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be moved into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price, well-priced business, and that work is currently in flight. Regarding the real estate, we continue to look at all our options on the table equivalent to what we've seen now, stores, warehousing and other assets. But again, we're still in the process of valuing that with outside support. We've made a bold first move with that.

So I think that as we look at the buckets, we definitely see improvement in our COGS, and we're deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base as well as we look to the more long-term proposition of how we build out our own brand capabilities and invest in better price points and, therefore, better margins. So COGS is going to be 1 of those considerations. I think across the board, we've seen and then pre-identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work and when we think more than enterprise.

Brad, let me kind of take the first piece, which is harvesting the merchandising benefits. As I expressed a little earlier, we're knee-deep in that at the moment. I'm really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of  having seen better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment. I think 1 of the real strengths of the season when we're under pressure is that we were able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth. And the team have done a great job in terms of keeping the lead on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business. So that's a real strength. It helps set us up to 2020 in a really positive way. As I mentioned earlier, the ideas around harvesting own brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review. And I've already conducted that, and we've begun the process of that. But that's not an overnight inflation, and we want to get it right. But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of own brand curated with national brand to create a unique and differentiated home authority. And so that's clearly on the agenda. Time of harvest, size of harvest, stay tuned. I'm going to come back in spring to outline our overall plan, and that's what we're very actively working on at the moment. In terms of Q4, we're still in the middle of that, and we're not going to be declaring any numbers there. But we have said that we continue to remain under pressure.

I think the issue for us was in the sum of the quarter of the Thanksgiving, it came in the closing days and it came with a bang. But our lead-in was relatively soft, and we did  lack great traffic enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter. And that's a huge learning for us, and we won't repeat that in 2020. But what we did see is not only being over the extra day, but we started entering into Thanksgiving period and we saw real pressure on sales, and we realized that some of our activity in digital by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period, which was distorting our true price value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time. We made really sharp pivot, and I was really proud of the team, and we instantly saw key items, we're winning share back. We were watching it hour by hour. And we're able to do that in digital first, of course, because of our agility there. Having a stronger presence in-store of signage and offers, and we think that's something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that [ 360 ] experience. They all lend itself to a much stronger period.

So in terms of the Thanksgiving period, this was the first time that we actually deployed an active mass promotional strategy, not a coupon strategy. And I think that what we did inside that is we destacked it, so there was an absolute. And I think it talked clearly and resonated freely with the customer about value. And that's a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market. So it's not a long-running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one but where we see that we can strike with a simple, effective promotion, and they won't be as steep as we've shown here.

I mean I think that I'm -- we're looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer -- how the customer has learned new ways of shopping and new way of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board. And the key elements of those are really around a digital-first strategy, what we're calling omni always, and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience. Like we've seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw our mobile conversion outpace our desktop version for the very first time. And that's with the app playing a great role, and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer. We see that is in convenience is a very important part of our business. And I think that the last 12 months to 2 years, it's really seen a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical, especially around BOPUS where there's been a lot of growth. And I don't think we've been geared effectively for that, and I think we've been missing out on that opportunity. We've seen some really great double-digit comp growth in our ROPUS business, but that is reserve online, buy on store, which is still creating friction for the guest to have to go through the actual purchase of the store. We're going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPUS environment, which we see a competition already flourishing in that. So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at our competition and seeing how they're succeeding, but also how they're implementing future guest behavior, and we're looking to more quickly come on board with that. We know that we have been behind in that. And that's everything from assortment, pricing, how we represent online and install, how we make it easier for customers to shop. All these are highly emulatable. But we also want to make sure that during that process, we're creating a unique and differentiated model from other retailers. So implement, yes; copying, no.

I'll start with just the private brand strategy because, obviously, that's something that you come with very fresh, a lot of experience in.

And so creating our own brand stable really does take 2 things. I mean it takes a talented team, it takes a clear strategy but also takes great partners. And we're cultivating all 3 at the moment. We have an existing team who are very strong. We're currently deepening our partnership work. Our team has been out in Asia, working through that in the December period to fast track that. We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labels into a more meaningful own brand portfolio, and that's high on our agenda. There will be some infrastructure investment to get even greater talent to add to our team to get the job done. But this is why we're currently in flux looking at our overall SG&A to make sure that we can really recut our operations to self-fund and drive these businesses. We see setting up this team in full but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG&A as a result. But we're really excited to build of that team and build a portfolio and a staged set of events. As I've done in prior companies around the introduction of owned and defendable brands that you can only find in Bed Bath & Beyond and in our portfolio.

I mean I actually was just reviewing some data around that yesterday, and some really very positive signs there. I think that that's been a tougher market for everyone in total. But particularly in our baby business, we've been gaining market share as a result of our registry, and we're building deeper trust and engagement with our customers. And I think that it's a way that we can reignite our engagement even further. We've seen some decline in our overall sales and registry while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space. We are known for this. I think it's something we won't ignore, and we'll find ways to ignite it inside our strategic plan.

72944058,646946776,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1888024,2,5,2020-01-09 00:56:24,3612,73932671,2,2,412425,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath & Beyond's President and CEO. For many years, I've watched and admired this company as a competitor as well as a customer, reflecting on my own family's Back to College experiences. I'm excited for the opportunity to reconstruct, renovate and restore this iconic retailer.
For almost half a century, Bed Bath & Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home. And I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers' lives. To do so, we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs.
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago, I have been fully immersed in the business to assess our operations, our portfolio, our capabilities and our culture. My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath & Beyond has been affirmed. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. As a business, we have substantial scale with over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and in Canada, strong brand awareness amongst our customers and a business model that is supported by our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation.
From day 1, I've received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change. During my store visits, I've witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win. I've also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened to and responded directly to many customer concerns.
Turning to our recent quarterly performance. We reported sales of $2.8 billion, an 8.3% comp sales decline and an adjusted loss of $0.38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share. The business was challenged by pre and post the Thanksgiving holiday period despite favorable results on a shifted basis during the 5-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday.
Let me be clear, these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sets of priorities and purpose. We must respond to the challenges we face as a business, including pressured sales and profitability, and reconstruct a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth. A path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
Now let me discuss our preliminary approach to lead our company into the future. We'll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months, but today, I want to share some high-level insights into where we are heading.
First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity. Let's start with some data here. Based on results of a recent brand health tracker study, an NPD consumer tracking data, Bed Bath & Beyond is #1 in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and is a strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath. Overall, 79% of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand, and 75% of customers want to buy from our top categories such as home textiles and housewares. This data demonstrates that Bed Bath & Beyond is still a beloved, well-known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a $51 billion U.S. market for the home-related categories we offer. We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share to build stronger authority and performance.
The data also speaks to our challenges, including a lack of clarity around purpose and value and a softer connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories. In addition, we know in our industry that 80% of traffic is influenced by a digital touch point, reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to drastically improve our digital platform. There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home categories for mass retailers; new competition from direct consumer brands; increased customer expectations across store, digital and delivery experiences; and the reality that the next generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first. As such, we'll be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, including quickly evolving our strong performing Reserve Online, Pick up In-Store offering to a full Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, or BOPUS, model during the first half of fiscal 2020.
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination. In doing so, we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers. Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition, one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels, customer segments, demographics and occasions. As such, we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD Group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data-driven services, which will enable us to more clearly review pricing, share and white space opportunities. Later this year, to build upon this partnership, we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies.
Regarding our go-forward strategy, we'll be grounded in the following 5 pillars. First, our product. We will refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath & Beyond and create energy through differentiation and curation. Second, our price. We'll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice with opening price points, relevant owned brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers. Third is our promise. We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting, engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value. Fourth is our place. We will accelerate and optimize connecting with, inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni-always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs. And lastly, but critically important, is our people. We'll create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts, retains and develops high-performance teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results.
With these 5 pillars as our guide, we're embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. We look forward to sharing more details on these 5 strategic pillars and expectations for future performance over the next few months. We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020, and we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans.
In the meantime, our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near-term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth. We've been reviewing and optimizing the company's asset base, including the portfolio of retail banners as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest. We've been reviewing and resetting the cost structure, modernizing for growth and refining our organization, which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG&A, including reducing overhead, improving sourcing, increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain. We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals.
While our top line still remains challenged, we've made tangible progress on many of these priorities. One action we've taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction, which generated net proceeds of over $250 million. This deal includes commercial space, including retail stores, a distribution facility and our corporate office in Union, New Jersey, which will be -- continued to be occupied under the long-term leases. This activity marks the first step towards unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth, financial stability and shareholder value.
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the Board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation, the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash-generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the company's core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce the company's outstanding debt or some combination of these. While we can't outline any specifics at this time, we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and working through the process with our outside advisers.
In connection with this process, the company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate. Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course.
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model, we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently, effectively. A rethink of the company's leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath & Beyond forward. Last month, I announced extensive changes to our leadership team, including the departure of 6 senior members. We'll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas but also the right organizational structure to facilitate a more streamlined decision-making, to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath & Beyond's authority in the home space.
Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new, innovative leaders of change will help us to better anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs. During this period of transition, I am grateful to our leaders who have stepped up to provide key interim leadership in merchandising, digital, marketing, owned brands and legal. I've been buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided. I'll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together. In connection with the leadership announcement, I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already. The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high, and I'm confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions.
In other activity, as part of our strategic focus, we have been further evaluating our product assortment. We're taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of owned brands balanced with a powerful arsenal of core national brands. More to come on this soon.
Here are some of the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company, one in which we work together to build a better business every day in a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home. With respect to our sales stabilization efforts, we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period, benefiting from all our stores being open on Thanksgiving Day this year, new promotional activities and new pricing models. Comparing these 5 days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday 2019 versus 2018, comp sales actually increased by 7.1% supported by growth in physical stores of over 5% and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13%. These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently, we can create meaningful positive outcomes. While the strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred, we will be sharpening our value for quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new ones.
As I said earlier, our third quarter results were unsatisfactory. To some extent, our performance was impacted by self-inflicted issues such as poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPUS, which I do know can be rectified going forward. In the near term, we will be focused on these issues in our operating model. And while improved performance will not be linear, we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently.
In short, my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well positioned for long-term success. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. I truly believe this is one of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country, and I'm excited about the future of our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financials. And then afterwards, I will make some closing remarks. Robyn?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Our reported net loss this quarter include a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share for special items, which include a favorable adjustment of $24 million to the company's previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns that was partially offset by a noncash charge of $12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets. On an adjusted basis, our non-GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.38.
To better represent the year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019, my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge as well as last year's gain from the building sale. As a reminder, our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30 and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving, while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1 and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week.
Net sales in the quarter were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8.3% and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined in the high single-digit percentage range, while comp sales from our digital channel declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, there was 1 less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods, our comp sales declined only 3.6%, with a decline in store sales of 6.5% and growth in digital sales of 9.4%.
During a like-for-like comparable period covering the 5 days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, our performance showed comp sales growth of 7.1%, including growth in stores of over 5% and digital growth in excess of 13%. Despite the calendar shift, our business remains challenged with some self-inflicted issues, including poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options, and we are working to address these issues.
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers, we executed a rapid refresh of 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout. We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period, including special in-store and online sales events and the launch of our first-ever national Black Friday advertising campaign. Overall, these are positive steps, but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins.
Moving now to the gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.3% of net sales as compared to 33.1% in the third quarter of last year. This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Our BEYOND+ membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1.4 million members. While the BEYOND+ customer spends more and visits more often, the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin, including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which is similar to the prior year impact.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $931.8 million or 33.8% of net sales as compared to $982.5 million or 32.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This $51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure, including lower payroll and payroll-related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization efforts, partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, the 140 basis point increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, on a lower sales base as well as from higher advertising expenses. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 20.6% and includes $2.8 million of net after-tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter.
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $920 million in cash and investments. Retail inventories of $2.7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10% or $289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period, excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns. This 10% reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9%.
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier. As we disclosed last quarter, we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near-term priority to review and optimize our asset base. This included the removal of approximately $350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday.
In conjunction with this decision, we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of $194 million in the second quarter. We have subsequently refined our plan. And as a result, we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned. And therefore, we recorded a $24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter. This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $188 million with nearly 50% related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings.
During the third quarter, we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened 4 stores. We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores, including about 20 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We had previously planned to close 60 total stores, including about 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We have decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell-through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative. We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores, including about 2 Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019.
Regarding share repurchase activity. We had a low level of engagement in the market, repurchasing $1.2 million or 87,000 shares during the quarter. And as Mark stated earlier, our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the Board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on April 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020.
Similar to our third quarter results, we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Considering these headwinds and Mark's ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go-forward strategic plan as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a few additional pieces of information. First, our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pretax earnings will include the following items: approximately $11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately $33 million of a loss related to the sale leaseback transaction. Second, our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately $275 million to $300 million compared to our previous estimate of between $350 million to $375 million. This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects.
And finally, in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transaction, we will incur annual incremental pretax net occupancy cost of $11 million, which began with the closing of the transaction in late December. Our balance sheet will include roughly $190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction. The transaction generated net proceeds of more than $250 million and included about 2.1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations, 1 distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey. And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years.
I will now turn the call back over to Mark for some closing remarks.",Robyn D��Elia,27484248.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It is clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals. I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results, we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively. The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision.
So today, I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going. We're experiencing short-term pain, some of which has been self-inflicted. We are making bold and broad-based changes to modernize our business. We have a solid balance sheet. We will have a relentless focus on our customer. We'll act as a true omnichannel retailer. We will be agile and take a measured approach. And as such, these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable, durable business model.
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures, different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery. Through the lens of these experiences, I can see our company's fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me to look objectively at the business and make bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore Bed Bath & Beyond. We have plenty of options and a healthy balance sheet, as I've said, to get to work and accomplish our goals.
As I said before, our path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Our entire team of more than 60,000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath & Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution. We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy, and we'll share these plans with you over the coming months. We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath & Beyond to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We're all dedicated to advancing our company for the benefit of our customers, our vendor partners and our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to open the call to your questions.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Thanks, Curt. So in terms of the time frame, again, we're still in the process of evaluation, and I want to be really clear here, continuing to accelerate the existing transformation work that was put in place which is really solid, and we've been able to double down on that since becoming onboard. And just looking to get clarity on our priorities, our investments and our Capex, we still have a few balls in the air there that we're looking to solidify so we could help prioritize and build that plan. That's why I'm sharing that I'll come back in the spring to be really clear on our 2020 plan and the pagination of those goals. So it's more work to be done but work in flight, so stay tuned on that. So the time line and the operating model will be commensurate with that. But there's some individual efforts that are already taking shape, and we see ourselves doubling down on those. To date, they're mostly focused on operational strength and excellence and reconciliation.

So let's start with couponing. So I think what -- the keyword that I think comes to mind here is really balance. So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA, and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with. But we do see that there's an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer. And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they're searching online, which is the primary vehicle for research. So really rebalancing our opening price points, price right daily as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward. We're already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be morphed into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price, well-priced business, and that work is currently in flight.
Regarding the real estate, we continue to look at all our options on the table equivalent to what we've seen now, stores, warehousing and other assets.

And then along those lines, can you provide your initial assessment of which areas of the business need the most investments?",Atul Maheswari,330944019.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

So I think that as we look at the buckets, we definitely see improvement in our COGS, and we're deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base as well as we look to the more long-term proposition of how we build out our owned brand capabilities and invest in better price points and, therefore, better margins. So COGS is going to be one of those considerations. I think across the board, we've seen and have pre-identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work. And when we think more as an enterprise and with more agility, we can actually reduce some of these costs.
We've looked at all the buckets, and I'm not going to specify which ones at this point because we're still work in flight, where we see investing is really going to be what I talked about, in those 5 pillars. We invest in our experience through our plays, in our people through our team, in our product and our promise. And so we're going to really drive value. And clearly, from what I've stated, digital will be one of the key areas.

I guess at a high level, Mark, I was hoping you could help us think about the near-term opportunities to improve merchandising and sourcing and costs that do seem to be pretty tremendous as we look at the company from the outside and just your willingness to try to harvest them and flow them through to the bottom line in the shorter term versus that opportunity to maybe reinvest in the business for the longer term and just how you're thinking about balancing those two. And then just as it relates to the fourth quarter, I was hoping you can give us a little more color around how December played out and if we should be thinking of that versus the negative 8% comp that you reported or the negative 3.6% adjusted just as we try to calibrate our models for the fourth quarter, any more color you can provide would be helpful.",Bradley Thomas,47285801.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

So Brad, let me kind of take the first piece, which is harvesting the merchandising benefit. As I expressed a little earlier, we're knee-deep in that at the moment. I'm really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of harvesting better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment. I think one of the real strengths of the season when we're under pressure is that we were able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth. And the team had done a great job in terms of keeping the lid on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business. So that's a real strength. It helps set us up for 2020 in a really positive way.
As I mentioned earlier, the ideas around harvesting owned brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review, and I've already conducted that, and we've begun the process of that. But that's not an overnight sensation, and we want to get it right. But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of owned brand curated with national brand to create a unique and differentiated home authority. And so that's clearly on the agenda. Time of harvest, size of harvest, stay tuned. I'm going to come back when we, in spring, outline our overall plan, and that's what we're very actively working on at the moment.
In terms of Q4, we're still in the middle of that, and we're not going to be declaring any numbers there. But we have said that we continue to remain under pressure. And we're working through how we're performing there, and we have a number of balls in the air on what our options are and how we're going to come out.

So I can give you an overview, and Robyn will add some color to the actual numbers. I think, Seth, the issue for us was in the sum of the quarter, the Thanksgiving came in the closing days, and it came with a bang. But our lead-in was relatively soft, and we did lack great traffic enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter. And that's a huge learning for us, and we won't repeat that in 2020. But what we did see is not only open the extra day, but we started entering into Thanksgiving period, and we saw real pressure on sales. And we realized that some of our activity in digital, by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period, was distorting our true price value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time.
We made really sharp pivots, and I was really proud of the team, and we instantly saw key items we're winning share back. We're watching it hour by hour. And we're able to do that digital first, of course, because of our agility there. Having a stronger presence in-store of signage and offers, and we think that's something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that 360 experience. So they all lend itself to a much stronger period. Again, late in the quarter and only a small part of our overall performance, but they did give us green shoots of opportunity to say when we act and think differently, we can win.

And that's a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market. So it's not a long-running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one. But where we see that we can strike with a simple, effective promotion, and they won't be as steep as we've shown here, this was, as I've said in the time and place, we'll balance that out with a portfolio of regular coupon and meaningful promotions.

It's a great question. I think that the great spot that we're in is the criteria isn't necessarily cash because we are so cash rich and we can add to that to invest in our business and do a number of different things. The criteria really is around what do we see is fundamentally connected to our core and that we can build sustainable growth and really build equity over time and also to what is an addition to our current workload or a subtraction to our current workload and our focus. So our portfolio is wide. They're all strong, and they're all great assets. But who we want to be in 1, 2, 3 years' time, I think we want to see ourselves as a core nucleus of brands and businesses that are interrelated and that can support one another and create true economies of scale.

I mean I think that I'm -- we're looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer -- how the customer has learned new ways of shopping, new ways of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board. And the key elements of those are really around a digital-first strategy, what we're calling an omni-always, and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience. Like we've seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw our mobile conversion outpace our desktop conversion for the very first time, and that's with the app playing a great role, and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer. We see that ease and convenience is a very important part of our business. And I think that the last 12 months to 2 years is really seeing a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical, especially around BOPUS where there's been a lot of growth. And I don't think we've been geared effectively for that, and I think we've been missing out on that opportunity. We've seen some really great double-digit comp growth in our ROPUS business. But that is Reserve Online, Buy In-Store, which is still creating friction for the guest to have to go through the actual purchase at store. We're going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPUS environment, which we see our competition already flourishing in that.
So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at our competition and seeing how they succeed but also how they're influencing future guest behavior, and we're looking to more quickly come on board with that. We know that we have been behind in that. That's everything from assortment, pricing, how we represent online and in-store, how we make it easier for customers to shop. All these are highly emulatable. But we also want to make sure that during that process, we're creating a unique and differentiated model from other retailers. So influence, yes; copying, no. And we have a great opportunity being a single authority in the home space to create a really unique 360 omni-always environment that I look forward to fast-tracking and sharing with you guys.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

We have an existing team who are very strong. We're currently deepening our partnership work. Our team has been out in Asia, working through that in the December period to fast track that. We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labels into a more meaningful owned brand portfolio, and that's high on our agenda. There will be some infrastructure investment to get even greater talent to add to that team to get the job done. But this is why we're currently in flux, looking at our overall SG&A to make sure that we can really recut our operations to self-fund and drive these businesses. We see setting up this team in full but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG&A as a result.

And I think that it's a way that we can reignite our engagement even further. We've seen some declines in our overall sales and registry while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space. We are known for this. I think it's something we won't ignore, and we'll find ways to ignite it inside our strategic plan.

72944058,646946776,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1888043,8,5,2020-01-09 02:38:24,3612,73933416,2,2,412425,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath & Beyond's President and CEO. For many years, I've watched and admired this company as a competitor as well as a customer, reflecting on my own family's Back to College experiences. I'm excited for the opportunity to reconstruct, renovate and restore this iconic retailer.
For almost half a century, Bed Bath & Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home. And I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers' lives. To do so, we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs.
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago, I have been fully immersed in the business to assess our operations, our portfolio, our capabilities and our culture. My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath & Beyond has been affirmed. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. As a business, we have substantial scale with over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and in Canada, strong brand awareness amongst our customers and a business model that is supported by our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation.
From day 1, I've received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change. During my store visits, I've witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win. I've also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened to and responded directly to many customer concerns.
Turning to our recent quarterly performance. We reported sales of $2.8 billion, an 8.3% comp sales decline and an adjusted loss of $0.38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share. The business was challenged by pre and post the Thanksgiving holiday period despite favorable results on a shifted basis during the 5-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday.
Let me be clear, these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sets of priorities and purpose. We must respond to the challenges we face as a business, including pressured sales and profitability, and reconstruct a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth. A path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
Now let me discuss our preliminary approach to lead our company into the future. We'll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months, but today, I want to share some high-level insights into where we are heading.
First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity. Let's start with some data here. Based on results of a recent brand health tracker study, an NPD consumer tracking data, Bed Bath & Beyond is #1 in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and is a strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath. Overall, 79% of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand, and 75% of customers want to buy from our top categories such as home textiles and housewares. This data demonstrates that Bed Bath & Beyond is still a beloved, well-known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a $51 billion U.S. market for the home-related categories we offer. We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share to build stronger authority and performance.
The data also speaks to our challenges, including a lack of clarity around purpose and value and a softer connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories. In addition, we know in our industry that 80% of traffic is influenced by a digital touch point, reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to drastically improve our digital platform. There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home categories for mass retailers; new competition from direct consumer brands; increased customer expectations across store, digital and delivery experiences; and the reality that the next generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first. As such, we'll be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, including quickly evolving our strong performing Reserve Online, Pick up In-Store offering to a full Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, or BOPUS, model during the first half of fiscal 2020.
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination. In doing so, we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers. Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition, one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels, customer segments, demographics and occasions. As such, we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD Group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data-driven services, which will enable us to more clearly review pricing, share and white space opportunities. Later this year, to build upon this partnership, we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies.
Regarding our go-forward strategy, we'll be grounded in the following 5 pillars. First, our product. We will refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath & Beyond and create energy through differentiation and curation. Second, our price. We'll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice with opening price points, relevant owned brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers. Third is our promise. We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting, engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value. Fourth is our place. We will accelerate and optimize connecting with, inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni-always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs. And lastly, but critically important, is our people. We'll create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts, retains and develops high-performance teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results.
With these 5 pillars as our guide, we're embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. We look forward to sharing more details on these 5 strategic pillars and expectations for future performance over the next few months. We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020, and we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans.
In the meantime, our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near-term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth. We've been reviewing and optimizing the company's asset base, including the portfolio of retail banners as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest. We've been reviewing and resetting the cost structure, modernizing for growth and refining our organization, which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG&A, including reducing overhead, improving sourcing, increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain. We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals.
While our top line still remains challenged, we've made tangible progress on many of these priorities. One action we've taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction, which generated net proceeds of over $250 million. This deal includes commercial space, including retail stores, a distribution facility and our corporate office in Union, New Jersey, which will be -- continued to be occupied under the long-term leases. This activity marks the first step towards unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth, financial stability and shareholder value.
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the Board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation, the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash-generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the company's core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce the company's outstanding debt or some combination of these. While we can't outline any specifics at this time, we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and working through the process with our outside advisers.
In connection with this process, the company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate. Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course.
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model, we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently, effectively. A rethink of the company's leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath & Beyond forward. Last month, I announced extensive changes to our leadership team, including the departure of 6 senior members. We'll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas but also the right organizational structure to facilitate a more streamlined decision-making, to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath & Beyond's authority in the home space.
Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new, innovative leaders of change will help us to better anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs. During this period of transition, I am grateful to our leaders who have stepped up to provide key interim leadership in merchandising, digital, marketing, owned brands and legal. I've been buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided. I'll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together. In connection with the leadership announcement, I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already. The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high, and I'm confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions.
In other activity, as part of our strategic focus, we have been further evaluating our product assortment. We're taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of owned brands balanced with a powerful arsenal of core national brands. More to come on this soon.
Here are some of the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company, one in which we work together to build a better business every day in a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home. With respect to our sales stabilization efforts, we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period, benefiting from all our stores being open on Thanksgiving Day this year, new promotional activities and new pricing models. Comparing these 5 days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday 2019 versus 2018, comp sales actually increased by 7.1% supported by growth in physical stores of over 5% and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13%. These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently, we can create meaningful positive outcomes. While the strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred, we will be sharpening our value for quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new ones.
As I said earlier, our third quarter results were unsatisfactory. To some extent, our performance was impacted by self-inflicted issues such as poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPUS, which I do know can be rectified going forward. In the near term, we will be focused on these issues in our operating model. And while improved performance will not be linear, we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently.
In short, my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well positioned for long-term success. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. I truly believe this is one of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country, and I'm excited about the future of our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financials. And then afterwards, I will make some closing remarks. Robyn?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43
72944058,646946776,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1888043,8,5,2020-01-09 02:38:24,3612,73933417,3,2,363007,"Thank you, Mark. Let's start with a review of our GAAP results. We reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.31 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.18 in the prior year period, which included a benefit of $0.16 from a gain on the sale of a building. Our reported net loss this quarter include a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share for special items, which include a favorable adjustment of $24 million to the company's previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns that was partially offset by a noncash charge of $12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets. On an adjusted basis, our non-GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.38.
To better represent the year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019, my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge as well as last year's gain from the building sale. As a reminder, our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30 and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving, while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1 and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week.
Net sales in the quarter were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8.3% and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined in the high single-digit percentage range, while comp sales from our digital channel declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, there was 1 less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods, our comp sales declined only 3.6%, with a decline in store sales of 6.5% and growth in digital sales of 9.4%.
During a like-for-like comparable period covering the 5 days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, our performance showed comp sales growth of 7.1%, including growth in stores of over 5% and digital growth in excess of 13%. Despite the calendar shift, our business remains challenged with some self-inflicted issues, including poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options, and we are working to address these issues.
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers, we executed a rapid refresh of 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout. We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period, including special in-store and online sales events and the launch of our first-ever national Black Friday advertising campaign. Overall, these are positive steps, but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins.
Moving now to the gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.3% of net sales as compared to 33.1% in the third quarter of last year. This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Our BEYOND+ membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1.4 million members. While the BEYOND+ customer spends more and visits more often, the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin, including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which is similar to the prior year impact.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $931.8 million or 33.8% of net sales as compared to $982.5 million or 32.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This $51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure, including lower payroll and payroll-related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization efforts, partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, the 140 basis point increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, on a lower sales base as well as from higher advertising expenses. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 20.6% and includes $2.8 million of net after-tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter.
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $920 million in cash and investments. Retail inventories of $2.7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10% or $289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period, excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns. This 10% reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9%.
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier. As we disclosed last quarter, we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near-term priority to review and optimize our asset base. This included the removal of approximately $350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday.
In conjunction with this decision, we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of $194 million in the second quarter. We have subsequently refined our plan. And as a result, we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned. And therefore, we recorded a $24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter. This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $188 million with nearly 50% related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings.
During the third quarter, we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened 4 stores. We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores, including about 20 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We had previously planned to close 60 total stores, including about 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We have decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell-through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative. We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores, including about 2 Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019.
Regarding share repurchase activity. We had a low level of engagement in the market, repurchasing $1.2 million or 87,000 shares during the quarter. And as Mark stated earlier, our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the Board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on April 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020.
Similar to our third quarter results, we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Considering these headwinds and Mark's ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go-forward strategic plan as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a few additional pieces of information. First, our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pretax earnings will include the following items: approximately $11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately $33 million of a loss related to the sale leaseback transaction. Second, our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately $275 million to $300 million compared to our previous estimate of between $350 million to $375 million. This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects.
And finally, in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transaction, we will incur annual incremental pretax net occupancy cost of $11 million, which began with the closing of the transaction in late December. Our balance sheet will include roughly $190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction. The transaction generated net proceeds of more than $250 million and included about 2.1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations, 1 distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey. And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years.
I will now turn the call back over to Mark for some closing remarks.",Robyn D��Elia,27484248.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It is clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals. I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results, we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively. The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision.
So today, I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going. We're experiencing short-term pain, some of which has been self-inflicted. We are making bold and broad-based changes to modernize our business. We have a solid balance sheet. We will have a relentless focus on our customer. We'll act as a true omnichannel retailer. We will be agile and take a measured approach. And as such, these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable, durable business model.
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures, different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery. Through the lens of these experiences, I can see our company's fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me to look objectively at the business and make bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore Bed Bath & Beyond. We have plenty of options and a healthy balance sheet, as I've said, to get to work and accomplish our goals.
As I said before, our path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Our entire team of more than 60,000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath & Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution. We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy, and we'll share these plans with you over the coming months. We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath & Beyond to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We're all dedicated to advancing our company for the benefit of our customers, our vendor partners and our shareholders.

Thanks, Curt. So in terms of the time frame, again, we're still in the process of evaluation, and I want to be really clear here, continuing to accelerate the existing transformation work that was put in place which is really solid, and we've been able to double down on that since becoming onboard. And just looking to get clarity on our priorities, our investments and our Capex, we still have a few balls in the air there that we're looking to solidify so we could help prioritize and build that plan. That's why I'm sharing that I'll come back in the spring to be really clear on our 2020 plan and the pagination of those goals. So it's more work to be done but work in flight, so stay tuned on that. So the time line and the operating model will be commensurate with that. But there's some individual efforts that are already taking shape, and we see ourselves doubling down on those. To date, they're mostly focused on operational strength and excellence and reconciliation.

So let's start with couponing. So I think what -- the keyword that I think comes to mind here is really balance. So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA, and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with. But we do see that there's an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer. And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they're searching online, which is the primary vehicle for research. So really rebalancing our opening price points, price right daily as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward. We're already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be morphed into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price, well-priced business, and that work is currently in flight.
Regarding the real estate, we continue to look at all our options on the table equivalent to what we've seen now, stores, warehousing and other assets. But again, we're still in the process of evaluating that with outside support. We've made a bold first move with that.

So I think that as we look at the buckets, we definitely see improvement in our COGS, and we're deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base as well as we look to the more long-term proposition of how we build out our owned brand capabilities and invest in better price points and, therefore, better margins. So COGS is going to be one of those considerations. I think across the board, we've seen and have pre-identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work. And when we think more as an enterprise and with more agility, we can actually reduce some of these costs.
We've looked at all the buckets, and I'm not going to specify which ones at this point because we're still work in flight, where we see investing is really going to be what I talked about, in those 5 pillars. We invest in our experience through our plays, in our people through our team, in our product and our promise. And so we're going to really drive value.

So Brad, let me kind of take the first piece, which is harvesting the merchandising benefit. As I expressed a little earlier, we're knee-deep in that at the moment. I'm really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of harvesting better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment. I think one of the real strengths of the season when we're under pressure is that we were able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth. And the team had done a great job in terms of keeping the lid on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business. So that's a real strength. It helps set us up for 2020 in a really positive way.
As I mentioned earlier, the ideas around harvesting owned brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review, and I've already conducted that, and we've begun the process of that. But that's not an overnight sensation, and we want to get it right. But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of owned brand curated with national brand to create a unique and differentiated home authority. And so that's clearly on the agenda. Time of harvest, size of harvest, stay tuned. I'm going to come back when we, in spring, outline our overall plan, and that's what we're very actively working on at the moment.
In terms of Q4, we're still in the middle of that, and we're not going to be declaring any numbers there. But we have said that we continue to remain under pressure.

So I can give you an overview, and Robyn will add some color to the actual numbers. I think, Seth, the issue for us was in the sum of the quarter, the Thanksgiving came in the closing days, and it came with a bang. But our lead-in was relatively soft, and we did lack great traffic enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter. And that's a huge learning for us, and we won't repeat that in 2020. But what we did see is not only open the extra day, but we started entering into Thanksgiving period, and we saw real pressure on sales. And we realized that some of our activity in digital, by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period, was distorting our true price value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time.
We made really sharp pivots, and I was really proud of the team, and we instantly saw key items we're winning share back. We're watching it hour by hour. And we're able to do that digital first, of course, because of our agility there. Having a stronger presence in-store of signage and offers, and we think that's something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that 360 experience. So they all lend itself to a much stronger period. Again, late in the quarter and only a small part of our overall performance, but they did give us green shoots of opportunity to say when we act and think differently, we can win.

So in terms of the Thanksgiving period, this was the first time that we actually deployed an active mass promotional strategy, not a coupon strategy. And I think that what we did inside those, we destacked it, so there was an absolute. And I think it talked clearly and resonated freely with the customer about value. And that's a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market. So it's not a long-running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one. But where we see that we can strike with a simple, effective promotion, and they won't be as steep as we've shown here, this was, as I've said in the time and place, we'll balance that out with a portfolio of regular coupon and meaningful promotions.

I mean I think that I'm -- we're looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer -- how the customer has learned new ways of shopping, new ways of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board. And the key elements of those are really around a digital-first strategy, what we're calling an omni-always, and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience. Like we've seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw our mobile conversion outpace our desktop conversion for the very first time, and that's with the app playing a great role, and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer. We see that ease and convenience is a very important part of our business. And I think that the last 12 months to 2 years is really seeing a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical, especially around BOPUS where there's been a lot of growth. And I don't think we've been geared effectively for that, and I think we've been missing out on that opportunity. We've seen some really great double-digit comp growth in our ROPUS business. But that is Reserve Online, Buy In-Store, which is still creating friction for the guest to have to go through the actual purchase at store. We're going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPUS environment, which we see our competition already flourishing in that.
So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at our competition and seeing how they succeed but also how they're influencing future guest behavior, and we're looking to more quickly come on board with that. We know that we have been behind in that. That's everything from assortment, pricing, how we represent online and in-store, how we make it easier for customers to shop. All these are highly emulatable. But we also want to make sure that during that process, we're creating a unique and differentiated model from other retailers. So influence, yes; copying, no. And we have a great opportunity being a single authority in the home space to create a really unique 360 omni-always environment that I look forward to fast-tracking and sharing with you guys.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

So creating our owned brand stable really does take 2 things. I mean it takes a talented team, it takes a clear strategy but also takes great partners. And we're cultivating all 3 at the moment. We have an existing team who are very strong. We're currently deepening our partnership work. Our team has been out in Asia, working through that in the December period to fast track that. We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labels into a more meaningful owned brand portfolio, and that's high on our agenda. There will be some infrastructure investment to get even greater talent to add to that team to get the job done. But this is why we're currently in flux, looking at our overall SG&A to make sure that we can really recut our operations to self-fund and drive these businesses. We see setting up this team in full but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG&A as a result. But we're really excited to build off that team and build a portfolio and a staged set of events as I've done in prior companies around the introduction of owned and dependable brands that you can only find in Bed Bath & Beyond and in our portfolio.

I mean I actually was just reviewing some data around that yesterday, and some really very positive signs there. I think that that's been a tougher market for everyone in total. But particularly in our baby business, we've been gaining market share as a result of our registry, and we're building deeper trust and engagement with our customers. And I think that it's a way that we can reignite our engagement even further. We've seen some declines in our overall sales and registry while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space. We are known for this. I think it's something we won't ignore, and we'll find ways to ignite it inside our strategic plan.

I'm delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath & Beyond's President and CEO. For many years, I've watched and admired this company as a competitor as well as a customer, reflecting on my own family's Back to College experiences. I'm excited for the opportunity to reconstruct, renovate and restore this iconic retailer.
For almost half a century, Bed Bath & Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home. And I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers' lives. To do so, we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs.
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago, I have been fully immersed in the business to assess our operations, our portfolio, our capabilities and our culture. My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath & Beyond has been affirmed. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. As a business, we have substantial scale with over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and in Canada, strong brand awareness amongst our customers and a business model that is supported by our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation.
From day 1, I've received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change. During my store visits, I've witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win. I've also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened to and responded directly to many customer concerns.
Turning to our recent quarterly performance. We reported sales of $2.8 billion, an 8.3% comp sales decline and an adjusted loss of $0.38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share. The business was challenged by pre and post the Thanksgiving holiday period despite favorable results on a shifted basis during the 5-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday.
Let me be clear, these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sets of priorities and purpose. We must respond to the challenges we face as a business, including pressured sales and profitability, and reconstruct a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth. A path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
Now let me discuss our preliminary approach to lead our company into the future. We'll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months, but today, I want to share some high-level insights into where we are heading.
First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity. Let's start with some data here. Based on results of a recent brand health tracker study, an NPD consumer tracking data, Bed Bath & Beyond is #1 in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and is a strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath. Overall, 79% of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand, and 75% of customers want to buy from our top categories such as home textiles and housewares. This data demonstrates that Bed Bath & Beyond is still a beloved, well-known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a $51 billion U.S. market for the home-related categories we offer. We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share to build stronger authority and performance.
The data also speaks to our challenges, including a lack of clarity around purpose and value and a softer connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories. In addition, we know in our industry that 80% of traffic is influenced by a digital touch point, reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to drastically improve our digital platform. There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home categories for mass retailers; new competition from direct consumer brands; increased customer expectations across store, digital and delivery experiences; and the reality that the next generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first. As such, we'll be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, including quickly evolving our strong performing Reserve Online, Pick up In-Store offering to a full Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, or BOPUS, model during the first half of fiscal 2020.
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination. In doing so, we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers. Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition, one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels, customer segments, demographics and occasions. As such, we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD Group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data-driven services, which will enable us to more clearly review pricing, share and white space opportunities. Later this year, to build upon this partnership, we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies.
Regarding our go-forward strategy, we'll be grounded in the following 5 pillars. First, our product. We will refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath & Beyond and create energy through differentiation and curation. Second, our price. We'll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice with opening price points, relevant owned brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers. Third is our promise. We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting, engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value. Fourth is our place. We will accelerate and optimize connecting with, inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni-always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs. And lastly, but critically important, is our people. We'll create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts, retains and develops high-performance teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results.
With these 5 pillars as our guide, we're embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. We look forward to sharing more details on these 5 strategic pillars and expectations for future performance over the next few months. We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020, and we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans.
In the meantime, our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near-term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth. We've been reviewing and optimizing the company's asset base, including the portfolio of retail banners as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest. We've been reviewing and resetting the cost structure, modernizing for growth and refining our organization, which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG&A, including reducing overhead, improving sourcing, increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain. We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals.
While our top line still remains challenged, we've made tangible progress on many of these priorities. One action we've taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction, which generated net proceeds of over $250 million. This deal includes commercial space, including retail stores, a distribution facility and our corporate office in Union, New Jersey, which will be -- continued to be occupied under the long-term leases. This activity marks the first step towards unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth, financial stability and shareholder value.
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the Board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation, the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash-generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the company's core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce the company's outstanding debt or some combination of these. While we can't outline any specifics at this time, we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and working through the process with our outside advisers.
In connection with this process, the company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate. Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course.
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model, we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently, effectively. A rethink of the company's leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath & Beyond forward. Last month, I announced extensive changes to our leadership team, including the departure of 6 senior members. We'll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas but also the right organizational structure to facilitate a more streamlined decision-making, to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath & Beyond's authority in the home space.
Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new, innovative leaders of change will help us to better anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs. During this period of transition, I am grateful to our leaders who have stepped up to provide key interim leadership in merchandising, digital, marketing, owned brands and legal. I've been buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided. I'll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together. In connection with the leadership announcement, I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already. The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high, and I'm confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions.
In other activity, as part of our strategic focus, we have been further evaluating our product assortment. We're taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of owned brands balanced with a powerful arsenal of core national brands. More to come on this soon.
Here are some of the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company, one in which we work together to build a better business every day in a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home. With respect to our sales stabilization efforts, we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period, benefiting from all our stores being open on Thanksgiving Day this year, new promotional activities and new pricing models. Comparing these 5 days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday 2019 versus 2018, comp sales actually increased by 7.1% supported by growth in physical stores of over 5% and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13%. These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently, we can create meaningful positive outcomes. While the strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred, we will be sharpening our value for quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new ones.
As I said earlier, our third quarter results were unsatisfactory. To some extent, our performance was impacted by self-inflicted issues such as poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPUS, which I do know can be rectified going forward. In the near term, we will be focused on these issues in our operating model. And while improved performance will not be linear, we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently.
In short, my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well positioned for long-term success. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. I truly believe this is one of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country, and I'm excited about the future of our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financials. And then afterwards, I will make some closing remarks. Robyn?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43
72944058,646946776,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1888983,1,5,2020-01-13 23:46:00,3612,73969435,3,2,363007,"Thank you, Mark. Let's start with a review of our GAAP results. We reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.31 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.18 in the prior year period, which included a benefit of $0.16 from a gain on the sale of a building. Our reported net loss this quarter include a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share for special items, which include a favorable adjustment of $24 million to the company's previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns that was partially offset by a noncash charge of $12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets. On an adjusted basis, our non-GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.38.
To better represent the year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019, my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge as well as last year's gain from the building sale. As a reminder, our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30 and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving, while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1 and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week.
Net sales in the quarter were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8.3% and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined in the high single-digit percentage range, while comp sales from our digital channel declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, there was 1 less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods, our comp sales declined only 3.6%, with a decline in store sales of 6.5% and growth in digital sales of 9.4%.
During a like-for-like comparable period covering the 5 days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, our performance showed comp sales growth of 7.1%, including growth in stores of over 5% and digital growth in excess of 13%. Despite the calendar shift, our business remains challenged with some self-inflicted issues, including poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options, and we are working to address these issues.
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers, we executed a rapid refresh of 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout. We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period, including special in-store and online sales events and the launch of our first-ever national Black Friday advertising campaign. Overall, these are positive steps, but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins.
Moving now to the gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.3% of net sales as compared to 33.1% in the third quarter of last year. This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Our BEYOND+ membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1.4 million members. While the BEYOND+ customer spends more and visits more often, the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin, including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which is similar to the prior year impact.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $931.8 million or 33.8% of net sales as compared to $982.5 million or 32.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This $51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure, including lower payroll and payroll-related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization efforts, partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, the 140 basis point increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, on a lower sales base as well as from higher advertising expenses. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 20.6% and includes $2.8 million of net after-tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter.
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $920 million in cash and investments. Retail inventories of $2.7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10% or $289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period, excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns. This 10% reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9%.
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier. As we disclosed last quarter, we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near-term priority to review and optimize our asset base. This included the removal of approximately $350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday.
In conjunction with this decision, we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of $194 million in the second quarter. We have subsequently refined our plan. And as a result, we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned. And therefore, we recorded a $24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter. This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $188 million with nearly 50% related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings.
During the third quarter, we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened 4 stores. We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores, including about 20 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We had previously planned to close 60 total stores, including about 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We have decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell-through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative. We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores, including about 2 Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019.
Regarding share repurchase activity. We had a low level of engagement in the market, repurchasing $1.2 million or 87,000 shares during the quarter. And as Mark stated earlier, our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the Board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on April 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020.
Similar to our third quarter results, we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Considering these headwinds and Mark's ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go-forward strategic plan as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a few additional pieces of information. First, our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pretax earnings will include the following items: approximately $11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately $33 million of a loss related to the sale leaseback transaction. Second, our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately $275 million to $300 million compared to our previous estimate of between $350 million to $375 million. This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects.
And finally, in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transaction, we will incur annual incremental pretax net occupancy cost of $11 million, which began with the closing of the transaction in late December. Our balance sheet will include roughly $190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction. The transaction generated net proceeds of more than $250 million and included about 2.1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations, 1 distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey. And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years.

It is clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals. I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results, we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively. The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision.
So today, I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going. We're experiencing short-term pain, some of which has been self-inflicted. We are making bold and broad-based changes to modernize our business. We have a solid balance sheet. We will have a relentless focus on our customer. We'll act as a true omnichannel retailer. We will be agile and take a measured approach. And as such, these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable, durable business model.
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures, different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery. Through the lens of these experiences, I can see our company's fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me to look objectively at the business and make bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore Bed Bath & Beyond. We have plenty of options and a healthy balance sheet, as I've said, to get to work and accomplish our goals.
As I said before, our path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Our entire team of more than 60,000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath & Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution. We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy, and we'll share these plans with you over the coming months. We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath & Beyond to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We're all dedicated to advancing our company for the benefit of our customers, our vendor partners and our shareholders.

And just looking to get clarity on our priorities, our investments and our Capex, we still have a few balls in the air there that we're looking to solidify so we could help prioritize and build that plan. That's why I'm sharing that I'll come back in the spring to be really clear on our 2020 plan and the pagination of those goals. So it's more work to be done but work in flight, so stay tuned on that. So the time line and the operating model will be commensurate with that. But there's some individual efforts that are already taking shape, and we see ourselves doubling down on those.

So let's start with couponing. So I think what -- the keyword that I think comes to mind here is really balance. So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA, and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with. But we do see that there's an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer. And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they're searching online, which is the primary vehicle for research. So really rebalancing our opening price points, price right daily as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward. We're already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be morphed into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price, well-priced business, and that work is currently in flight.
Regarding the real estate, we continue to look at all our options on the table equivalent to what we've seen now, stores, warehousing and other assets.

So I think that as we look at the buckets, we definitely see improvement in our COGS, and we're deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base as well as we look to the more long-term proposition of how we build out our owned brand capabilities and invest in better price points and, therefore, better margins. So COGS is going to be one of those considerations. I think across the board, we've seen and have pre-identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work. And when we think more as an enterprise and with more agility, we can actually reduce some of these costs.
We've looked at all the buckets, and I'm not going to specify which ones at this point because we're still work in flight, where we see investing is really going to be what I talked about, in those 5 pillars. We invest in our experience through our plays, in our people through our team, in our product and our promise. And so we're going to really drive value.

I guess at a high level, Mark, I was hoping you could help us think about the near-term opportunities to improve merchandising and sourcing and costs that do seem to be pretty tremendous as we look at the company from the outside and just your willingness to try to harvest them and flow them through to the bottom line in the shorter term versus that opportunity to maybe reinvest in the business for the longer term and just how you're thinking about balancing those two.

So Brad, let me kind of take the first piece, which is harvesting the merchandising benefit. As I expressed a little earlier, we're knee-deep in that at the moment. I'm really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of harvesting better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment. I think one of the real strengths of the season when we're under pressure is that we were able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth. And the team had done a great job in terms of keeping the lid on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business. So that's a real strength. It helps set us up for 2020 in a really positive way.
As I mentioned earlier, the ideas around harvesting owned brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review, and I've already conducted that, and we've begun the process of that. But that's not an overnight sensation, and we want to get it right. But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of owned brand curated with national brand to create a unique and differentiated home authority. And so that's clearly on the agenda. Time of harvest, size of harvest, stay tuned. I'm going to come back when we, in spring, outline our overall plan, and that's what we're very actively working on at the moment.
In terms of Q4, we're still in the middle of that, and we're not going to be declaring any numbers there. But we have said that we continue to remain under pressure. And we're working through how we're performing there, and we have a number of balls in the air on what our options are and how we're going to come out.

So I can give you an overview, and Robyn will add some color to the actual numbers. I think, Seth, the issue for us was in the sum of the quarter, the Thanksgiving came in the closing days, and it came with a bang. But our lead-in was relatively soft, and we did lack great traffic enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter. And that's a huge learning for us, and we won't repeat that in 2020. But what we did see is not only open the extra day, but we started entering into Thanksgiving period, and we saw real pressure on sales. And we realized that some of our activity in digital, by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period, was distorting our true price value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time.
We made really sharp pivots, and I was really proud of the team, and we instantly saw key items we're winning share back. We're watching it hour by hour. And we're able to do that digital first, of course, because of our agility there. Having a stronger presence in-store of signage and offers, and we think that's something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that 360 experience. So they all lend itself to a much stronger period. Again, late in the quarter and only a small part of our overall performance, but they did give us green shoots of opportunity to say when we act and think differently, we can win.

And then also just maybe how that relates to your initial take, Mark, on the value proposition of the BEYOND+ membership program given that there is some inherent value, right, with those members' abilities to utilize coupons all the time and the frequency -- increasing the frequency and the depth of the coupon for everyone sort of distorts the value.

So in terms of the Thanksgiving period, this was the first time that we actually deployed an active mass promotional strategy, not a coupon strategy. And I think that what we did inside those, we destacked it, so there was an absolute. And I think it talked clearly and resonated freely with the customer about value. And that's a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market. So it's not a long-running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one. But where we see that we can strike with a simple, effective promotion, and they won't be as steep as we've shown here, this was, as I've said in the time and place, we'll balance that out with a portfolio of regular coupon and meaningful promotions.

I mean I think that I'm -- we're looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer -- how the customer has learned new ways of shopping, new ways of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board. And the key elements of those are really around a digital-first strategy, what we're calling an omni-always, and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience. Like we've seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw our mobile conversion outpace our desktop conversion for the very first time, and that's with the app playing a great role, and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer. We see that ease and convenience is a very important part of our business. And I think that the last 12 months to 2 years is really seeing a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical, especially around BOPUS where there's been a lot of growth. And I don't think we've been geared effectively for that, and I think we've been missing out on that opportunity. We've seen some really great double-digit comp growth in our ROPUS business. But that is Reserve Online, Buy In-Store, which is still creating friction for the guest to have to go through the actual purchase at store. We're going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPUS environment, which we see our competition already flourishing in that.
So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at our competition and seeing how they succeed but also how they're influencing future guest behavior, and we're looking to more quickly come on board with that. We know that we have been behind in that. That's everything from assortment, pricing, how we represent online and in-store, how we make it easier for customers to shop. All these are highly emulatable. But we also want to make sure that during that process, we're creating a unique and differentiated model from other retailers. So influence, yes; copying, no.

So creating our owned brand stable really does take 2 things. I mean it takes a talented team, it takes a clear strategy but also takes great partners. And we're cultivating all 3 at the moment. We have an existing team who are very strong. We're currently deepening our partnership work. Our team has been out in Asia, working through that in the December period to fast track that. We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labels into a more meaningful owned brand portfolio, and that's high on our agenda. There will be some infrastructure investment to get even greater talent to add to that team to get the job done. But this is why we're currently in flux, looking at our overall SG&A to make sure that we can really recut our operations to self-fund and drive these businesses. We see setting up this team in full but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG&A as a result. But we're really excited to build off that team and build a portfolio and a staged set of events as I've done in prior companies around the introduction of owned and dependable brands that you can only find in Bed Bath & Beyond and in our portfolio.

I mean I actually was just reviewing some data around that yesterday, and some really very positive signs there. I think that that's been a tougher market for everyone in total. But particularly in our baby business, we've been gaining market share as a result of our registry, and we're building deeper trust and engagement with our customers. And I think that it's a way that we can reignite our engagement even further. We've seen some declines in our overall sales and registry while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space. We are known for this. I think it's something we won't ignore, and we'll find ways to ignite it inside our strategic plan.

I'm delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath & Beyond's President and CEO. For many years, I've watched and admired this company as a competitor as well as a customer, reflecting on my own family's Back to College experiences. I'm excited for the opportunity to reconstruct, renovate and restore this iconic retailer.
For almost half a century, Bed Bath & Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home. And I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers' lives. To do so, we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs.
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago, I have been fully immersed in the business to assess our operations, our portfolio, our capabilities and our culture. My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath & Beyond has been affirmed. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. As a business, we have substantial scale with over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and in Canada, strong brand awareness amongst our customers and a business model that is supported by our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation.
From day 1, I've received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change. During my store visits, I've witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win. I've also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened to and responded directly to many customer concerns.
Turning to our recent quarterly performance. We reported sales of $2.8 billion, an 8.3% comp sales decline and an adjusted loss of $0.38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share. The business was challenged by pre and post the Thanksgiving holiday period despite favorable results on a shifted basis during the 5-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday.
Let me be clear, these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sets of priorities and purpose. We must respond to the challenges we face as a business, including pressured sales and profitability, and reconstruct a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth. A path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
Now let me discuss our preliminary approach to lead our company into the future. We'll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months, but today, I want to share some high-level insights into where we are heading.
First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity. Let's start with some data here. Based on results of a recent brand health tracker study, an NPD consumer tracking data, Bed Bath & Beyond is #1 in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and is a strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath. Overall, 79% of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand, and 75% of customers want to buy from our top categories such as home textiles and housewares. This data demonstrates that Bed Bath & Beyond is still a beloved, well-known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a $51 billion U.S. market for the home-related categories we offer. We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share to build stronger authority and performance.
The data also speaks to our challenges, including a lack of clarity around purpose and value and a softer connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories. In addition, we know in our industry that 80% of traffic is influenced by a digital touch point, reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to drastically improve our digital platform. There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home categories for mass retailers; new competition from direct consumer brands; increased customer expectations across store, digital and delivery experiences; and the reality that the next generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first. As such, we'll be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, including quickly evolving our strong performing Reserve Online, Pick up In-Store offering to a full Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, or BOPUS, model during the first half of fiscal 2020.
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination. In doing so, we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers. Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition, one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels, customer segments, demographics and occasions. As such, we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD Group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data-driven services, which will enable us to more clearly review pricing, share and white space opportunities. Later this year, to build upon this partnership, we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies.
Regarding our go-forward strategy, we'll be grounded in the following 5 pillars. First, our product. We will refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath & Beyond and create energy through differentiation and curation. Second, our price. We'll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice with opening price points, relevant owned brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers. Third is our promise. We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting, engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value. Fourth is our place. We will accelerate and optimize connecting with, inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni-always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs. And lastly, but critically important, is our people. We'll create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts, retains and develops high-performance teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results.
With these 5 pillars as our guide, we're embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. We look forward to sharing more details on these 5 strategic pillars and expectations for future performance over the next few months. We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020, and we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans.
In the meantime, our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near-term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth. We've been reviewing and optimizing the company's asset base, including the portfolio of retail banners as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest. We've been reviewing and resetting the cost structure, modernizing for growth and refining our organization, which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG&A, including reducing overhead, improving sourcing, increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain. We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals.
While our top line still remains challenged, we've made tangible progress on many of these priorities. One action we've taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction, which generated net proceeds of over $250 million. This deal includes commercial space, including retail stores, a distribution facility and our corporate office in Union, New Jersey, which will be -- continued to be occupied under the long-term leases. This activity marks the first step towards unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth, financial stability and shareholder value.
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the Board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation, the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash-generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the company's core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce the company's outstanding debt or some combination of these. While we can't outline any specifics at this time, we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and working through the process with our outside advisers.
In connection with this process, the company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate. Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course.
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model, we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently, effectively. A rethink of the company's leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath & Beyond forward. Last month, I announced extensive changes to our leadership team, including the departure of 6 senior members. We'll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas but also the right organizational structure to facilitate a more streamlined decision-making, to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath & Beyond's authority in the home space.
Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new, innovative leaders of change will help us to better anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs. During this period of transition, I am grateful to our leaders who have stepped up to provide key interim leadership in merchandising, digital, marketing, owned brands and legal. I've been buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided. I'll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together. In connection with the leadership announcement, I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already. The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high, and I'm confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions.
In other activity, as part of our strategic focus, we have been further evaluating our product assortment. We're taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of owned brands balanced with a powerful arsenal of core national brands. More to come on this soon.
Here are some of the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company, one in which we work together to build a better business every day in a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home. With respect to our sales stabilization efforts, we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period, benefiting from all our stores being open on Thanksgiving Day this year, new promotional activities and new pricing models. Comparing these 5 days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday 2019 versus 2018, comp sales actually increased by 7.1% supported by growth in physical stores of over 5% and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13%. These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently, we can create meaningful positive outcomes. While the strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred, we will be sharpening our value for quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new ones.
As I said earlier, our third quarter results were unsatisfactory. To some extent, our performance was impacted by self-inflicted issues such as poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPUS, which I do know can be rectified going forward. In the near term, we will be focused on these issues in our operating model. And while improved performance will not be linear, we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently.
In short, my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well positioned for long-term success. We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers. I truly believe this is one of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country, and I'm excited about the future of our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financials. And then afterwards, I will make some closing remarks. Robyn?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Let's start with a review of our GAAP results. We reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.31 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.18 in the prior year period, which included a benefit of $0.16 from a gain on the sale of a building. Our reported net loss this quarter include a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share for special items, which include a favorable adjustment of $24 million to the company's previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns that was partially offset by a noncash charge of $12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets. On an adjusted basis, our non-GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.38.
To better represent the year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019, my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge as well as last year's gain from the building sale. As a reminder, our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30 and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving, while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1 and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week.
Net sales in the quarter were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8.3% and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined in the high single-digit percentage range, while comp sales from our digital channel declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, there was 1 less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods, our comp sales declined only 3.6%, with a decline in store sales of 6.5% and growth in digital sales of 9.4%.
During a like-for-like comparable period covering the 5 days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, our performance showed comp sales growth of 7.1%, including growth in stores of over 5% and digital growth in excess of 13%. Despite the calendar shift, our business remains challenged with some self-inflicted issues, including poor inventory management, noncompetitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options, and we are working to address these issues.
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers, we executed a rapid refresh of 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout. We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period, including special in-store and online sales events and the launch of our first-ever national Black Friday advertising campaign. Overall, these are positive steps, but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins.
Moving now to the gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.3% of net sales as compared to 33.1% in the third quarter of last year. This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Our BEYOND+ membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1.4 million members. While the BEYOND+ customer spends more and visits more often, the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin, including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which is similar to the prior year impact.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $931.8 million or 33.8% of net sales as compared to $982.5 million or 32.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This $51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure, including lower payroll and payroll-related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization efforts, partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, the 140 basis point increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, on a lower sales base as well as from higher advertising expenses. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 20.6% and includes $2.8 million of net after-tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter.
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $920 million in cash and investments. Retail inventories of $2.7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10% or $289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period, excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns. This 10% reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9%.
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier. As we disclosed last quarter, we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near-term priority to review and optimize our asset base. This included the removal of approximately $350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday.
In conjunction with this decision, we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of $194 million in the second quarter. We have subsequently refined our plan. And as a result, we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned. And therefore, we recorded a $24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter. This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $188 million with nearly 50% related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings.
During the third quarter, we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened 4 stores. We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores, including about 20 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We had previously planned to close 60 total stores, including about 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We have decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell-through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative. We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores, including about 2 Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019.
Regarding share repurchase activity. We had a low level of engagement in the market, repurchasing $1.2 million or 87,000 shares during the quarter. And as Mark stated earlier, our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the Board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the company's ongoing business transformation. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on April 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020.
Similar to our third quarter results, we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Considering these headwinds and Mark's ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go-forward strategic plan as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a few additional pieces of information. First, our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pretax earnings will include the following items: approximately $11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately $33 million of a loss related to the sale leaseback transaction. Second, our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately $275 million to $300 million compared to our previous estimate of between $350 million to $375 million. This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects.
And finally, in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transaction, we will incur annual incremental pretax net occupancy cost of $11 million, which began with the closing of the transaction in late December. Our balance sheet will include roughly $190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction. The transaction generated net proceeds of more than $250 million and included about 2.1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations, 1 distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey. And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years.
I will now turn the call back over to Mark for some closing remarks.",Robyn D��Elia,27484248.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It is clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals. I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results, we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively. The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision.
So today, I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going. We're experiencing short-term pain, some of which has been self-inflicted. We are making bold and broad-based changes to modernize our business. We have a solid balance sheet. We will have a relentless focus on our customer. We'll act as a true omnichannel retailer. We will be agile and take a measured approach. And as such, these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable, durable business model.
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures, different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery. Through the lens of these experiences, I can see our company's fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me to look objectively at the business and make bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore Bed Bath & Beyond. We have plenty of options and a healthy balance sheet, as I've said, to get to work and accomplish our goals.
As I said before, our path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results, but we will move quickly to cost correct and drive the business forward.
In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Our entire team of more than 60,000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath & Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution. We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy, and we'll share these plans with you over the coming months. We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath & Beyond to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We're all dedicated to advancing our company for the benefit of our customers, our vendor partners and our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to open the call to your questions.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Thanks, Curt. So in terms of the time frame, again, we're still in the process of evaluation, and I want to be really clear here, continuing to accelerate the existing transformation work that was put in place which is really solid, and we've been able to double down on that since becoming onboard. And just looking to get clarity on our priorities, our investments and our Capex, we still have a few balls in the air there that we're looking to solidify so we could help prioritize and build that plan. That's why I'm sharing that I'll come back in the spring to be really clear on our 2020 plan and the pagination of those goals. So it's more work to be done but work in flight, so stay tuned on that. So the time line and the operating model will be commensurate with that. But there's some individual efforts that are already taking shape, and we see ourselves doubling down on those. To date, they're mostly focused on operational strength and excellence and reconciliation.

So let's start with couponing. So I think what -- the keyword that I think comes to mind here is really balance. So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA, and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with. But we do see that there's an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer. And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they're searching online, which is the primary vehicle for research. So really rebalancing our opening price points, price right daily as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward. We're already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be morphed into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price, well-priced business, and that work is currently in flight.
Regarding the real estate, we continue to look at all our options on the table equivalent to what we've seen now, stores, warehousing and other assets.

So I think that as we look at the buckets, we definitely see improvement in our COGS, and we're deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base as well as we look to the more long-term proposition of how we build out our owned brand capabilities and invest in better price points and, therefore, better margins. So COGS is going to be one of those considerations. I think across the board, we've seen and have pre-identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work. And when we think more as an enterprise and with more agility, we can actually reduce some of these costs.
We've looked at all the buckets, and I'm not going to specify which ones at this point because we're still work in flight, where we see investing is really going to be what I talked about, in those 5 pillars. We invest in our experience through our plays, in our people through our team, in our product and our promise. And so we're going to really drive value.

I guess at a high level, Mark, I was hoping you could help us think about the near-term opportunities to improve merchandising and sourcing and costs that do seem to be pretty tremendous as we look at the company from the outside and just your willingness to try to harvest them and flow them through to the bottom line in the shorter term versus that opportunity to maybe reinvest in the business for the longer term and just how you're thinking about balancing those two. And then just as it relates to the fourth quarter, I was hoping you can give us a little more color around how December played out and if we should be thinking of that versus the negative 8% comp that you reported or the negative 3.6% adjusted just as we try to calibrate our models for the fourth quarter, any more color you can provide would be helpful.",Bradley Thomas,47285801.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

So Brad, let me kind of take the first piece, which is harvesting the merchandising benefit. As I expressed a little earlier, we're knee-deep in that at the moment. I'm really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of harvesting better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment. I think one of the real strengths of the season when we're under pressure is that we were able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth. And the team had done a great job in terms of keeping the lid on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business. So that's a real strength. It helps set us up for 2020 in a really positive way.
As I mentioned earlier, the ideas around harvesting owned brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review, and I've already conducted that, and we've begun the process of that. But that's not an overnight sensation, and we want to get it right. But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of owned brand curated with national brand to create a unique and differentiated home authority. And so that's clearly on the agenda. Time of harvest, size of harvest, stay tuned. I'm going to come back when we, in spring, outline our overall plan, and that's what we're very actively working on at the moment.
In terms of Q4, we're still in the middle of that, and we're not going to be declaring any numbers there. But we have said that we continue to remain under pressure. And we're working through how we're performing there, and we have a number of balls in the air on what our options are and how we're going to come out.

So I can give you an overview, and Robyn will add some color to the actual numbers. I think, Seth, the issue for us was in the sum of the quarter, the Thanksgiving came in the closing days, and it came with a bang. But our lead-in was relatively soft, and we did lack great traffic enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter. And that's a huge learning for us, and we won't repeat that in 2020. But what we did see is not only open the extra day, but we started entering into Thanksgiving period, and we saw real pressure on sales. And we realized that some of our activity in digital, by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period, was distorting our true price value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time.
We made really sharp pivots, and I was really proud of the team, and we instantly saw key items we're winning share back. We're watching it hour by hour. And we're able to do that digital first, of course, because of our agility there. Having a stronger presence in-store of signage and offers, and we think that's something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that 360 experience. So they all lend itself to a much stronger period. Again, late in the quarter and only a small part of our overall performance, but they did give us green shoots of opportunity to say when we act and think differently, we can win.

And that's a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market. So it's not a long-running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one. But where we see that we can strike with a simple, effective promotion, and they won't be as steep as we've shown here, this was, as I've said in the time and place, we'll balance that out with a portfolio of regular coupon and meaningful promotions.

It's a great question. I think that the great spot that we're in is the criteria isn't necessarily cash because we are so cash rich and we can add to that to invest in our business and do a number of different things. The criteria really is around what do we see is fundamentally connected to our core and that we can build sustainable growth and really build equity over time and also to what is an addition to our current workload or a subtraction to our current workload and our focus. So our portfolio is wide. They're all strong, and they're all great assets. But who we want to be in 1, 2, 3 years' time, I think we want to see ourselves as a core nucleus of brands and businesses that are interrelated and that can support one another and create true economies of scale.

I mean I think that I'm -- we're looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer -- how the customer has learned new ways of shopping, new ways of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board. And the key elements of those are really around a digital-first strategy, what we're calling an omni-always, and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience. Like we've seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw our mobile conversion outpace our desktop conversion for the very first time, and that's with the app playing a great role, and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer. We see that ease and convenience is a very important part of our business. And I think that the last 12 months to 2 years is really seeing a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical, especially around BOPUS where there's been a lot of growth. And I don't think we've been geared effectively for that, and I think we've been missing out on that opportunity. We've seen some really great double-digit comp growth in our ROPUS business. But that is Reserve Online, Buy In-Store, which is still creating friction for the guest to have to go through the actual purchase at store. We're going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPUS environment, which we see our competition already flourishing in that.
So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at our competition and seeing how they succeed but also how they're influencing future guest behavior, and we're looking to more quickly come on board with that. We know that we have been behind in that. That's everything from assortment, pricing, how we represent online and in-store, how we make it easier for customers to shop. All these are highly emulatable. But we also want to make sure that during that process, we're creating a unique and differentiated model from other retailers. So influence, yes; copying, no. And we have a great opportunity being a single authority in the home space to create a really unique 360 omni-always environment that I look forward to fast-tracking and sharing with you guys.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

We have an existing team who are very strong. We're currently deepening our partnership work. Our team has been out in Asia, working through that in the December period to fast track that. We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labels into a more meaningful owned brand portfolio, and that's high on our agenda. There will be some infrastructure investment to get even greater talent to add to that team to get the job done. But this is why we're currently in flux, looking at our overall SG&A to make sure that we can really recut our operations to self-fund and drive these businesses. We see setting up this team in full but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG&A as a result.

And I think that it's a way that we can reignite our engagement even further. We've seen some declines in our overall sales and registry while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space. We are known for this. I think it's something we won't ignore, and we'll find ways to ignite it inside our strategic plan.

As Janet said, we are coming together tonight from remote locations, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us under these unprecedented circumstances. 
Frankly, it seems like a different place and time. Life as we knew it before March is a distant memory. We are in the moment now, and I'd like to start by discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll talk about the strategic actions we are taking in this moment to build momentum around our transformation plans. Then Robyn will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide some further context around the potential impacts from the pandemic. 
Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers and our teams. We are providing essential infant, health and personal care items to local communities through our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores as well as serving the rest of our loyal customers online through our digital channels. Our teams are working around the clock to provide these essential products to our customers and to ensure the supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible. I would like to take a minute to personally thank our associate teams on behalf of management and the board. We thank you for your above and beyond service, attitude and dedication to our company and our customers despite this extremely challenging situation. Making it easy to feel at home means different things to different people, and our teams have been working incredibly hard to support our customers. I also want to say thank you to our customers and assure you that we will continue to work hard to help you access the essential products we sell as you manage through these very difficult times. 
In this moment, we are focused on facilitating and coordinating our ongoing response to the current pandemic. There is no historical playbook for this situation. But we have a remarkable team, robust contingency plans and a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to navigate this unprecedented challenge with confidence. We quickly initiated our contingency plan, creating an essential response unit with emergency task force groups to focus on several priority areas, including our people, operations, customers, technology and our finances. While this situation is like nothing we've seen before, we are adapting as necessary in taking decisive actions to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers and strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. This is an important time for us now and moving forward. Bed Bath & Beyond can play an important role in supporting customers and their families in making it easy to feel at home. 
All but approximately [ 170 ] of our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores are now temporarily closed, at least until May 2. We continue to provide essential products such as infant, health and personal care items in store, subject to state and local regulations, and online through our various digital channels. We are rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. They are relying on us more than ever to deliver a central product directly to their home. 
All 4 of our e-commerce fulfillment centers are currently operating. And by the end of this week, we will have converted approximately 25% of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers to use our vast inventory resources to assign orders locally and deliver quickly. 
With these conversions, we expanded our fulfillment capacity significantly. The regional fulfillment stores have doubled the capacity of our entire fulfillment network, facilitating approximately 44% of our overall daily orders with almost 40% of these orders being fulfilled within 50 miles of the customers' home. This has been an incredible learning curve for us, and we continue to optimize our regional fulfillment capabilities to deliver faster and at lower cost. 
While our supply chain is moving quickly to support our digital business in real time, rerouting products and the change in DCs and regional fulfillment stores, our technology team has stood up a 24-hour group to continuously refine the order allocation logic between the fulfillment stores and DCs. Our buying team is rerouting store and orders for the regional fulfillment locations to NDCs, while at the same time, canceling purchase orders and modifying receipt forecasts to reduce store inventory levels. 
On the consumer-facing side, our teams are closely monitoring top sellers and adjusting quickly to get products that our customers need and partnering with our vendors to help keep us in stock and well positioned. I want to thank all of our business partners for their efforts and collaboration during this time. 
This kind of strategic action and innovation had allowed us to quickly implement curbside pickup, which was launched April 1 at buybuy BABY. In the first full week alone, we completed more than 11,000 curbside orders. We're also introducing curbside pickup at our Harmon stores later this week. Also this week, we are rolling our Buy Online, Pick up In-Store at our BABY stores. We are quickly learning how our customers want to shop with us, and we will continue to evolve the process digitally to create a best-in-class experience. Both BOPUS and curbside pick up will be rolled out to our Bed Bath & Beyond stores as a new service offering for our customers where we can safely reopen. These new services were fast tracked during this period and will significantly enhance our pro forma capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. 
With the vast majority of our stores temporarily closed our customer-facing digital channels continue to service our customers, and we are seeing our online demand grow significantly. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond digital business is seeing net sales growth of more than 90% for the month of April to date, further strengthening our omnichannel strategic direction. This demand is being facilitated by our agile digital and marketing teams who are working together, responding to consumer data, creating newness and freshness across our sites, highlighting items customers need to make it easy to feel at home and communicating important information about changes in store hours and closures as well as safety measures so that our customers are clear on how we are operating and how they can shop with us. 
As the quarantine phase of this pandemic has taken hold, we are seeing consumer purchasing demand focus on categories such as water filtration, air purifiers, vaporizers and humidifiers as well as kitchen electrics, cleaning and coffee needs. Now over the past month, we sold the equivalent of 10 million cups of coffee and 400% loaf bread makers over the last year. And last week, we sold over 100% more vacuums compared to the same period of time last year. 
This action to temporary close out stores has, of course, fundamentally change the nature of our business in the short to midterm. The impact on our stores is obvious, but this decision affects the entire company. From IT to merchandising, finance to HR, the shape and structure of our business is radically different in this new environment across concepts and across the country. So in this moment, we are taking a holistic approach to managing our financial position, including larger efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen our liquidity. In conjunction with the recent decision to extend the temporary store closures, we implemented several additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of our store associates and a percentage of our corporate associates until at least May 2. Salaries will also reduce for myself and the executive team as well as the board. We put an immediate stock to $150 million in CapEx spend and put a hold on share repurchases as future dividends. Robyn will provide further detail on our productive measures in a minute. 
We are balancing our ability to provide jobs and financial support for our associates in the short, medium and long term as well as prioritizing investments designed to strengthen our business. We believe these actions will help us further weather the storm and preserve our financial health for the good of our associates, customers and shareholders. 
If there is a silver lining, I would say that given the monumental changes we've made to our business over the past 4 weeks, our ability to act decisively, partner up and move with speed and agility has been greatly enhanced. I'm very proud of the ideas, exploration and commitment that all our associates have made to serve our customers and our business. It's been incredible to come together as one united virtual team across the company to work together in ways perhaps that would have not been possible or even thought of in the past. We are leveraging this learning opportunity to be more collaborative and flexible in our focused priorities and then move more quickly so that we are ready to welcome our customers back when we can safely reopen our stores. 
We have also provided much needed support for local communities, serving food and care packages to seniors, military personnel and their families plus children in need from our Christmas Tree shop stores across the country. And we've donated more than 0.5 million Easter chocolate, candy, cookies, baskets and toys,to dozens of local charities, shelters, schools and community organizations nationwide from over 250 of our cost-plus world market stores. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, which just seem like a lifetime ago. In short, the pressures of store traffic trends and heavy promotional activity, coupled with the inventory management issues around the holiday selling period, hampered our efforts to stabilize the business in the fourth quarter. These trends are consistent with the information we provided on February 11 when we issued preliminary financial data for the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. 
Product availability with certain key promotional categories, such as kitchen electrics leading into the holiday period, were either too low or just out of stock. We just didn't have enough of the right stuff, which hurt us. We are confident this is fully rectifiable in terms of our learning plan and implementation from now until the back half of fiscal 2020. 
Our fourth quarter results were also pressured by heavier clearance activity during the quarter as we rapidly action on our strategic inventory reduction program. Now we surpassed the halfway mark of this initiative and are pleased with our progress. It's important to note that prior to this current business environment, we're resharpening our focus on inventory, ending the fourth quarter with approximately 16% less retail inventory at cost on an adjusted basis versus a year ago, so operating leaner and on a lower SKU base. We are now focusing our attention on optimizing our merchandising mix, which, of course, is a key focus for our new Chief Merchant, Joe Hartsig. 
For the full fourth quarter, we also reported a positive shift in sales across our digital channel with a return to strong growth about 16%. sales in our mobile channels for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY each grew more than [ 30% ] year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and orders taken through our mobile app were up 75%. These quarterly results strengthened our resolve to continue to make necessary bold and broad-based changes needed to modernize our business and gives us confidence about our ability to improve upon this quarterly performance. This includes the strategic restructuring program we implemented in late February to reduce annual SG&A expense by approximately $85 million and reset our cost structure. 
Prior to COVID-19, we had solid strategic plans for fiscal 2020. In this moment, we need to be agile and focused on simplifying and strengthening our business where it matters most to our customers and reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Let me now address the issues at hand and what we are working on. First, recruiting talent remains a top priority. We have an extensive interview process underway for the open roles. We have made bold moves. We have a robust process and have identified key candidates, with Joe Hartsig being the first major appointment as our new Chief Merchandising Officer. There will be more news on other great talent to come in the coming weeks. I'm excited to welcome Joe to the team. He has more than 30 years of experience in consumer brand development and retail merchandising with well-known consumer businesses like Walgreens, Walmart, Motorola and SC Johnson. To me, Joe is a merchant's merchant. And I'm looking to him to be a leader and a teacher as we rebuild our business, including improving key items in stocks and improving curation and further differentiation of our assortment, which is our #1 priority. 
Second, we remain focused on generating funds from the sale of assets and simplifying our business. In addition to the previously announced sale-leaseback transaction, we recently sold the One Kings Lane business to a third-party for an undisclosed amount. As previously disclosed, we ended in a definitive agreement to sell our PersonalizationMall.com business to 1-800-Flowers for $252 million 1-800 was required to close the transaction on March 30 but breached its obligation to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require them to close and intend to vigorously enforce our rights. 
While we can make no assurances, we will continue to pursue other portfolio adjustments and evaluate the remaining owned real estate in an effort to create a stronger and more focused portfolio. 
Lastly and most importantly, we are driving our strategic growth plans. Under the current business environment, we have modified our capital investments, but we'll continue to invest with confidence where it matters most. We now plan to invest about [ $250 million ] focusing on our core business and key projects that support the omnichannel future of our company in 2020 and beyond, which are more relevant than ever, such as our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including BOPUS and curbside pickup, omni inventory management as well as digital marketing and personalization. At a high level, we are reengineering our supply chain and our better relationships as well as further strengthening our own brand strategy. We are postponing story model due to the coronavirus situation and the timing issues it's created as we don't want to interfere with the critical third and fourth quarter holiday period,in 2020. We will also continue to review our store footprint as we have nearly 250 leases that are up for renewal in 2020 alone, which gives us added financial flexibility. 
In technology, we'll continue to invest in order allocation logic to better leverage our stores and fulfillment centers and improve our site speed and checkout experience in addition to simplifying the process. Now we have postponed our plans for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction to preserve our financial position and retain financial flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to longer term, and we will reevaluate when appropriate. Now is the time to stay liquid until we have more clarity on the global situations surrounding COVID-19. 
All the steps we've taken since I arrived at the company 5 short months ago, including this COVID-19 moment, reinforce our preliminary strategic plan focused on a singular purpose: to make it easy to feel at home. Our strategy will deliver against 5 key pillars, namely product, price, promise, place and people. We believe this strategy is more relevant today than ever and will support significant improvement in our financial performance and a deeper connection with our loyal customers. In this time, when home is even more central to our lives and being safe at home with family is essential, Bed Bath & Beyond takes on in an even more important role, supporting customers and their families,by making it easy to feel at home. We will provide inspiration and a curated affordable assortment so that our customers can create a home they love. 
Now before turning the call over to Robyn, I just wanted to mention that we have previously planned to host an investor event this spring. And now under these circumstances, we are exploring other options, including potentially a virtual event to take place at a more suitable time. We'll want to introduce you to the new team, showcase some of our new capabilities and early results and lay out our longer-term strategic growth objectives for the business. We'll keep you updated on our plans. 
While we deal with the immediate priorities, we continue our work to drive the company forward. We have robust contingency plans, and I am confident that we are able to navigate this crisis. We have an iconic brand with great consumer brand loyalty, and we're taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with our customers as we strengthen our omni always approach. I believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger, given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
Robyn will now review our fourth quarter results and then provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures we have taken to date to protect our financial position and maintain flexibility. I will then come back for some closing remarks.

78332623,660410850,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1955302,7,4,2020-04-15 23:13:26,5039,76790104,3,2,363007,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all faring well under these very unusual circumstances. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.92 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter includes an unfavorable impact of $0.91 per diluted share for special items, including $41 million in severance costs,related to the strategic restructuring program initiated in February 2020 and the extensive leadership changes announced in December 2019; a noncash charge of approximately $35 million for the impairment of certain store level assets; a noncash charge of approximately $33 million for the impairment of certain trade names and other assets; and an expense of $33 million related to the loss on the sale-leaseback transaction announced in January 2020. 
On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.38. 
The remainder of my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis as applicable consistent with our prior disclosures to better represent year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative period. From this year's fourth quarter, we exclude the items I just mentioned, along with the related impact on the provision for income taxes. And from last year's fourth quarter, we exclude the $510 million pretax goodwill impairment charge and  the related impact on the provision for income taxes. 
As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending February 29 and included the Cyber Monday Holiday week, while our fourth quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending March 2 and did not include the Cyber Monday Holiday week. 
On February 11, we reported preliminary unaudited financial performance data for the first 2 months of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We shared this update to provide visibility into the then current pressures on our business, including store traffic declines, combined with inventory management issues and the impact on revenue and margin resulting from increased promotional activity and markdowns. 
Net sales in the quarter were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 6.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 5.6%, reflecting a high single-digit decline in a number of transactions, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined about 10%, while comp sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 16%. 
Similar to last quarter, our sales in the fourth quarter were positively modified by the calendar shift of the Cyber Monday holiday week. Adjusting for this calendar shift to exclude the Cyber Monday holiday week in both periods, our comp sales for the quarter declined 11%, with a decline in store sales of 13.6% and growth in digital sales of 1.1%. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% of net sales as compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 210 basis point decline was primarily due to an unfavorable impact on merchandise margins from promotional activity and markdowns. In addition, we had an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense due to the higher penetration of digital sales within the total mix of quarterly sales. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was 30.7% of net sales as compared to 28.2% of net sales in the prior year period. This 250 basis point increase in SG&A, in order of magnitude, was primarily due to about 100 basis points of consulting expense associated with our efforts to expedite the ongoing transformation initiatives and review of assets and an increase in advertising expense, including digital marketing, related to the heavy promotional activity in the quarter, and to a lesser extent, the effect of fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation on a lower sales base. 
Our quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.3% on an adjusted basis and included $8.3 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. As a result of the lower pretax earnings base in the fourth quarter, these net after-tax benefits have a greater impact on the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year on an adjusted basis was 19.7% and included approximately $8.9 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring in that quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong cash position with about $1.4 billion in cash and investments, including over $250 million in net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed during the quarter. Adjusted retail inventories of $2.1 billion at cost, excluding a charge for markdowns associated with our inventory reduction initiative, reflected a significant reduction of about 16% or over $400 million net cost at the end of the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period. We continue to action against our previously communicated $1 billion inventory reduction program at retail, and we are now about halfway through the program and plan to continue to work down the remaining inventory in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to Capex. Our capital expenditures for the year were $277 million, with nearly [ 50% ] of the expense related to technology projects, primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx expense was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings. We closed 26 stores and opened 2 stores during the quarter. 
Regarding share repurchase activity, there were no open market repurchases during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have suspended repurchasing of our shares while conducting the review of our retail portfolio and real estate assets. The company currently remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to long term and will reevaluate when appropriate. To clarify, our previously announced first quarter dividend was paid on April 14 and was not impacted by the temporary suspension. 
Moving on to fiscal 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will, of course, be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. We're monitoring the situation closely regarding our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. 
We ended fiscal 2019 with cash and investments of $1.4 billion. And while we feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we plan to take or are taking proactive steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, such as drawing down the additional $236 million of available funds remaining from our revolving credit facility; suspended our plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction; postponed $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020, including some store remodels; furloughed the majority of our workforce, including store and corporate associates, until at least May 2, temporarily reduce the salaries of our executive team, including myself and Mark, by 30%; temporarily reduced the quarterly cash compensation of our independent Board of Directors by 30%; reducing discretionary spend, such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with maintenance of stores that are temporarily closed; renegotiating extensions of payment terms for goods and services and rents; managing to lower inventory levels; and implementing applicable benefits of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes,and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. 
Considering these circumstances, while we have trimmed CapEx by $150 million, we are now prioritizing approximately $250 million in essential capital expenditures to drive our strategic growth plans, as Mark described a few minutes ago. In addition, our capital structure provides further flexibility, including the potential to utilize significant balance sheet assets to generate incremental liquidity if needed. As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we had approximately $2 billion of quality, primarily nonseasonal inventory on our balance sheet, which has not been pledged as collateral under our existing debt arrangements. These actions, together with our strategic efforts to reset the organization's cost structure, including the recent restructuring program and our strong balance sheet, put us in a better position to manage through this period of uncertainty. We remain committed to keeping our shareholders informed about the business and our strategy to reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Now I would like to provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the full impact of this situation won't be known for months. However, what's important right now is that we are proactively managing the immediate challenges and playing an important role for our customers. As of Friday, March [ 20, ] we had temporarily closed over 50% of our stores across all banners until April 3. The approximately 700 stores that remained open in operation were stores that sell essential items such as health care, personal care, infant care, cleaning supplies or food and beverages. The following week, the company announced that it was temporarily closing all retail banners across the U.S. and Canada other than buybuy BABY and Harmon stores subject to state and local regulations. This left about 170 of our 1,500 stores in operation to provide the essential items we sell to customers. On April 2, we extended the temporary store closures until May 2. 
For the month of March, while we have not yet finalized our monthly results, we do have visibility to our sales performance. For the March period, we are able to share preliminary unaudited financial performance data. Overall, net sales across all banners were down approximately 31% versus the prior year March period. This was led by a decline of about 41% in store sales, as expected, due to less customer in-store shopping, resulting from self-quarantine guidelines and the initiation of temporary store closures and limited store hours. 
Net sales from our digital channels, however, were strong in March, up about 16%, benefiting from an increase in digital shopping due to COVID-19 and further enhancements we have made in our fulfillment capabilities, including converting about 25% of our temporary closed stores to regional fulfillment stores as Mark spoke about earlier. 
The sales performance for both buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores, which remain open to provide essential items, was better than the overall company for the March period. 
Through the first 2 weeks of April, the fiscal quarter-to-date overall decline in our total net sales is around 42%, primarily due to the additional temporary store closures. However, net sales from our digital channels have further strengthened with year-over-year growth of more than 35%. Due to the level of market uncertainty, we will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time. As we work through 2020, we believe our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business, and emerge from the crisis well positioned to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. Our strong cash position, along with our near-term actions, provide the company with continued financial resilience and ample short and midterm liquidity to fund the operations of the business. To reiterate what Mark said earlier, we do believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger, given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mark for some closing remarks.",Robyn D��Elia,27484248.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

As Robyn shared, we have tremendous opportunities to build and manage a modern durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. We'll be driving meaningful and inspiring engagements with our customers, refining and amplifying an exciting omnichannel assortment, provide compelling value through price and differentiation and delivering an omni-only shopping experience that serves our customers' needs. And we will continually look for ways to optimize our business model, whether through the supply chain or through other operating efficiencies across the business. We'll also take advantage of the market digitalization that has already occurred and that will likely to continue resulting in changes in the competitive landscape and opportunities for us to grow market share in the home, baby and personal care spaces. This time has been a test for all retailers. We believe that Bath & Beyond is positioned to come out stronger as we have the cash, the talent, the right plans and great loyal customers.

Look, I mean, Michael, on the opening, no crystal ball here for Mark Tritton. But here's what I would say to you. We are -- we've moved from and now to a next -- to a future proposition in terms of our strategic planning. And while we are securing our current scenario and managing our teams, we are working on the reemergence and the reentry into the market and how that that plays out. We don't have that time down, but we have multiple scenarios. We really tapped into major groups like [ Reeler, ] who are doing a fantastic job in terms of sharing data and working with government to establish what reentry looks like. And to your point, Michael, I do think that it will be a region-by-region based response.  We'll be part of a bevy of retailers that follow the guidelines of government and come back into the market only when it's safe for our teams and our customers, and we're following those guidelines strictly. Now when that is, we factored in our financial models on multiple scenarios, including a very elongated period. We feel really comfortable in terms of our cash burn and our liquidity as a result without touching any further available funds. And so we've looked at the map and we've looked at the time frame. The actual date we will be ready -- and as we've talked about, we've already accelerated a number of capabilities during this downtime like BOPUS, like curbside pickup and like store fulfill that we think are actually going to really sustain and benefit our total business, including the digital -- great digital growth we've been seeing through the fourth quarter and now into Q1.

You said you've taken through multiple scenarios where even on a long-dated basis, you're pretty comfortable. But could you give a little more detail in terms of what the time line is?

So we've got control cash burn we have cash, and we have a plan. Now this is not something that is years and years and years in the making. I think everyone is looking at this in these very short synapses but also looking at the worst-case scenarios. When we sat down with our Board and shared our worst-case scenarios, we have good liquidity, and we have stability in our business with the right actions taken to take us through. And I think we're in a really unusual position at -- in that we don't have rotting fruit in terms of our merchandise. We're primarily seasonless. We're not an apparel business, and we have sustainable product that we can leverage upon reentry, and we're not going to be in a blood bath in terms of cost. So there's some real benefits to this space. And there's no doubt that the home business has become very fruitful in this period, we just need the customers to be able to access us and other retailers and products in a more fluid way, which is an omnichannel environment of true digital and physical stores.

I think for us, it was tough to hit the COVID moment when we just saw some pivots happening in February. We knew we were plagued by issues in in December and January would be transparent around that. Some of it was self inflicted. I mean, when we don't have best sellers in stock, we've done discounting and we don't have our inventory. I mean, some of the sales decline we saw in our stores wasn't necessarily traffic. We did some intel work on that, that saw the customers were coming in and they just couldn't find the product in stock. So we were shooting ourselves in the foot. That is easily rectifiable, and we started to do that straight at the end of January. We saw positive comps coming through or more positive comps in terms of churn rate in February. And as we stated, we saw an acceleration of our digital business it was doing well during the period, but that accelerated even further. So we've been seeing our full year '19 business, we were about 19% penetration in digital and title. For the fourth quarter alone, that was up to 21.3%, and we had double-digit comps there. Now we've seen that digital business even more deeply accelerate with a lot of new customers, about 31%, 33% of our customers in this Q1 period being new to the Bed Bath & Beyond websites, buybuy BABY, et cetera. So we're garnering new business, and we're building plans with BOPUS, curbside and personalization to sustain those relationships. So we're excited, if that's a word I can even use in this moment, about what lies ahead. But it definitely was some gentle momentum coming our way that was positive in February, the [indiscernible] the December-January trends. And then we hit this [indiscernible] moment.

So I'm going to provide the total number, but I just shared, Simeon, like Q4, we're at 21.3% of total sales. And so we're getting that digital engagement and follow through with the customer. What we've seen is these very sharp synapses. And one of the things that Robyn was outlining is the periods in which we were partially open then closed, and then particularly in Bed Bath and then relying heavily on the digital business. We've seen strong conversion. It's never going to map out to be full coverage of our stores-based business. But we are seeing both demand and total sales in the 70%, 80% and 90% mark when we move into the April period. And as we mentioned, really ramping up and flexing with agility our capability to fill those orders, both in the stores that we're using as regional fulfillment centers as well as our DCs, have been tremendous. So we're meeting guest needs. We're working with them. We're fulfilling orders. We're working through our inventory, and we're building equity in our omni always business.

I think our mix is very fluid at the moment. I'm clearly -- people leaning into cleaning, into kitchen, into baking, into home care. And so this is a great time for us. Our textile business is not as strong, and that's something that we see coming forward as people look to refresh their home. We think this is going to be -- if people have been staring at the same 4 walls for a month or 2 now, Simeon, I think the idea of refreshing your bathroom, you bedroom, your kitchen. That's, going to be pivotal in terms of some of the engagement of customers and how they return into the market more than maybe an apparel purchase or definitely a travel purchase. So discretionary spending, I think, will be focused, and we may be a strong beneficiary there. So margin is balanced. And what we see is, is that our digital business always performs at a much lower coupon rate. And therefore, at this point, we're getting a really balanced response there. I think that the -- we see online acceleration. I think there are a lot of people who are talking around that. And I think the great thing about that is that some of the changes we've most recently made in terms of fulfillment and support. I mean, not having BOPIS versus the rest of the industry has been an Achilles' heel. We were set to launch that in full in main stores, and we've maintained that spend and commitment to be ready when our doors to open. And then have also added in curbside. and now we've stood up store fill, which was something that we had on our agenda, but we wanted to get through the other pieces first. We've accelerated those. And as you talked about that in terms of the impact, I'm no stranger with previous employers on the margin mix that a store fulfill via order or BOPUS can do in terms of the math and the margin on digital. So we'll start to model that out. Now is not the time to get accurate about that, but we believe that's positive things that lie ahead for us. And then we've already begun to convert some discretionary merchandise into more of an own brand platform ahead of a major relaunch in 2021 at the start. So we'll see some margin benefits for those products in the back end, the digital fulfill benefits in the back end.

Look, I mean, I think that we entered into promotional activity in a way that we hadn't ever before said. I think that if we go back to the third quarter, start of fourth quarter, it was the first time we'd ever really been truly promotional about a coupon. And  we really didn't on the plans to get there in the right way. So we burned the margin and we burn a lot of inventory and weren't prepared to get back into stock. So they're kind of tough learnings. But they're also redeemable moments that we can translate into new actions. I think that the one thing that I've noticed coming into the business and have been working with the team on is the role of value and price value equation. I think that we know that customers don't want to do the math and they want to have simple, readable affordability. And I think that's what we're missing from our equation. Both in-store and online, we haven't been making value. And I don't mean just sharp price. I mean, the resonating true value to the customer has been a little bit difficult in places than how we've operated. And so we've learned a ton of what not to do. And as a result, you're going to see coming through in our digital channel a refresh of how we're presenting value and talking to, I guess, with clarity and simplicity. You'll see that roll through circulars. And then when we open up, you'll start to see it manifest in things like end caps and price point presentation, a real clear, understandable everyday value. So we -- there's no doubt that as we come out of this COVID-19 moment, and with unemployment and some tough times ahead, customers want to be able to get value, see value, understand value and have it resonate with them quickly. And we think we've got some great plans in place to really step into that. And that doesn't mean giving away the margin farm. It just means being really clear on our intent upfront.

I've been working on -- since I joined on a program with the team, we've got 3 test stores that are showing really positive signs of growth from the core model, and that was without any assortment changes. Just any of the price point changes,and clarity that we talked about. So refreshment of the stores is something we then fast tracked. And we're ready to roll out 25, 26 stores to really give us a model to accelerate our spend in subsequent years. Now that was going to take place and be ready or before the beginning of the Back to College period so we didn't interrupt with our key selling period. And then into Q3, Q4, we would have been done. Having to ice those at the moment was really tough because we had some good work that we wanted to put into play. But it would have been crazy to spend that money, disrupt Q3 and Q4 and wanting to preserve some CapEx. So we've got the plans. We've got the info and we've got the dream.

Look, I mean, a couple of things there. I think that we've been -- Joe has been leading the charge here and having deep conversation with all our majors, and our general vendor base is about flow. If you go back to the inventory position that we had, there's kind of 2 things going there. The good news was that overall, we reduced our inventory by about 16% at the close of the quarter. And so we were working leaner on that. But inside of that, we did have big misses. Not by having more inventory. We think that's a good level that we can come down to. But we could have traded some of our mix to be more in stock about key items and generated more sales and gross margin by having the right merchandise. So again, the level coming down is a positive, the curation within the level becomes critical. Joe has really land into that charge, getting it back into stock about top 100, 250, 500 items and making sure that we can draw that down. I think also getting the flexibility to draw the stock from different places. It helps us to kind of speed up sales and get clarity and delivery to the customer on time. In terms of the point around the commitments, we quickly moved into an evaluation of high-risk merchandise, seasonal merchandise and anything that kind of -- if we looked at our long-term plan of what could have been a close at hold, really looking at minimizing our quantification of risk and adjusting flow. So that's a very fluid discussion, a very real discussion. And that began on day 1 when we started to see the problem emerge. So it will strengthen, having Joe on board, focusing on this. And our overall inventory plans are really highlighted by being in stock of best sellers, getting our pre plan with our vendors in place so that we could get that in stock and we play out the third and fourth quarter in a different way.

I think in general, in the industry, the consensus that I've been seeing, Jonathan, is that everyone is planning for -- I mean, this is not going to be a light switch moment where everything goes back to the immediate moment. We have got -- our financial plans are very conservative when I talked about the modeling in terms of an expectation of a highly reduced sales level so that we can work out our financial plan to be as liquid as possible no matter what. And so there's a number of percentages being bandied around there. I'm not going to contribute to the dialogue other than to say we have multiple scenarios, and some of them quite deep, to ensure that we've got our liquidity in place even if that the return is there. General -- I think there's going to be different rules here. I think you've got to remember that -- I think that this is -- we're looking at a lot of the recessionary moments from the past as models. But you also have the fear factor of safety and [indiscernible] so large gatherings, shopping at the mall, those things become more questionable, maybe for others. So less than 10% of our fleet is more based. We're big box and we're independent. We think that will work in our favor, and that helps us to do things like curbside pickup and the fluidity of BOPIS much faster than maybe a more based retailer. And we think there'll be a gradual turn on, but we also think there will be categories that come back faster. And I think that home will be a beneficiary much faster than apparel. And we think that there's positive upside to establishing relationships and transactions with customers early, but we know it's going to be graded.

Look, I mean, we've already identified and are moving forward on those strategies. So that remains unchanged with this moment, and I want to be really clear around that. A couple of things there, Brad. I think the first thing that we noticed, and we just talked about value earlier on the call, is that we have some real gaps in opening price point and the clarity of communication around value to our customers. So we're leaning into that space. I think the second piece is around really reducing a high level of duplication in items. And we really want to focus on a curation of differentiation and relevance to our customer. And where we've done that, we've seen real wins. In some of these stores that I was talking about earlier that I was playing with the models on, we've reduced the SKU count by 20% to 30%, and we were seeing double-digit comps at the same time. So when we curate, we make our assortment more focused and understandable. And then I've just been working even today on with Joe on a number of really great owned brands that we're cultivating and getting ready to launch at the start of next fiscal year because these things take time and we're developing newness there, which will help reframe our each of the key rooms and categories and occasions that we are currently dominant in and have strong market share but also ones where we want to cultivate. So I think that there's a modernity and a freshness and a relevance and affordability in that Home & Personal Care space as well as our efforts inside BABY, which were well underway. That can really create more relevant merchandise assortment. So we're upturning a lot of rocks there. We're renegotiating costs across the board, which had already been done and worked on. So there's a margin upside, there's a mix upside, and then there's a perception upside, including value, that we see coming. And that will be evolutionary throughout the rest of 2020, and you're really going to see some some strong green shoot in late 2020, early 2021.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I mean, look, I mean, I think we really would have been hitting on some high double digit comps. And I think that we had to restrain some demand based on availability of inventory, especially in key items. And so those items are strong. They're not markdown driven. That would have been a real boom for us, Seth. And I think that bodes well for where we can cut and pace those experiences into benefits in third and fourth quarter in 2020. And the upside of it, I think, is also going to be distorted by the current behavior in COVID-19. And that's why I'm really excited about the fact that we've built background capabilities very quickly to sustain that as the total market opens back up. And then we've been seeing where we have really changed the cadence of our communication dialogue in the way we've set up our digital website to be more relevant to weekly guest needs. We're really connecting with customers and driving high double-digit comps in those categories that we're leading into and building real engagement and data with these customers. So I think it's too early to say how high is high. In stream total believes that penetration rate will be increased. We're already on that pathway. And when I'm saying 21% of our business was already digital, we see a lot of upside in that, but we also want to balance out that with growth in our stores.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I mean, we've definitely seen the stay-at-home moments in terms of cooking and cleaning and supporting the family in this early piece have been really exceptional. I mean, bread makers and blenders and vacuums and cleaning products, water filtration, coffee, coffee, coffee, like -- people like how, we're just going to make the better bit at home. Now that's a boom for us. And we think -- we actually think that as people come out at this moment, we think that some of the data that we're seeing very early in its preliminary, there's going to be some discretionary spend move away from specific categories. But we believe that people will want to celebrate their home, reinforce it, refresh it, invite friends for smaller moments and build equity in entertaining and start to celebrate the home. And then leading into a Back to College moment, which were really primed, which is your Home Away Home, we're really ready to take on that. So I think this kind of new cocooning, new nesting, new love for home and valuing the environment -- while we all want to step outside, clearly, I think there's going to be safety as a consideration.

We know we're going to be in it for the long term. We know we're liquid. We know we're strong, and we have a plan and just let everybody work together on what we can do here. And so without going into great detail, know that those conversations were very robust, and we've asked for a level of support. It's just short to midterm, it's not the standard way we operate. And we'll all work on it together. And we've seen some really good lean in there to change that liquidity. And as I said, some of the burn rates we talked about earlier were not inclusive of those actions taking hold yet. So that's a further benefit to cash flow. But yes, look, with on our to-do list very early on, and we began in earnest to sit with our partners and renegotiate just in the short to mid how we can play with terms and how we can work.

Frankly, it seems like a different place and time. Life as we knew it before March is a distant memory. We are in the moment now, and I'd like to start by discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll talk about the strategic actions we are taking in this moment to build momentum around our transformation plans. Then Robert will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide some further context around the potential impacts from the pandemic. 
Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers and our teams. We are providing essential infant, health and personal care items to local communities through our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores as well as serving the rest of our loyal customers online through our digital channels. Our teams are working around the clock to provide these essential products to our customers and to ensure the supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible. I would like to take a minute to personally thank our associate teams on behalf of management and the Board. We thank you for your above and beyond service, attitude and dedication to our company and our loyal customers despite this extremely challenging situation. Making it easy to feel at home means different things to different people, and our teams have been working incredibly hard to support our customers. I also want to say thank you to our loyal customers and assure you that we will continue to work hard to help you access the essential products we sell as you manage through these very difficult times. 
In this moment, we are focused on facilitating and coordinating our ongoing response to the current pandemic. There is no historical playbook for this situation. But we have a remarkable team, robust contingency plans and a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to navigate this unprecedented challenge with confidence. We quickly initiated our contingency plan, creating an essential response unit with emergency task force groups to focus on several priority areas, including our people, operations, customers, technology and our finances. While this situation is like nothing we've seen before, we are adapting as necessary and taking decisive actions to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers and strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. This is an important time for us now and moving forward. Bed Bath & Beyond can play an important role in supporting customers and their families in making it easy to feel at home. 
All but approximately 170 of our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores are now temporarily closed at least until May 2. We continue to provide essential products such as infant, health and personal care items in store, subject to state and local regulations, and online through our various digital channels. We are rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. They are relying on us more than ever to deliver essential products directly to their home. 
All 4 of our e-commerce fulfillment centers are currently operating. And by the end of this week, we will have converted approximately 25% of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers to use our vast inventory resources to assign orders locally and deliver quickly. 
With these conversions, we expanded our fulfillment capacity significantly. The regional fulfillment stores have doubled the capacity of our entire fulfillment network, facilitating approximately 44% of our overall daily orders with almost 40% of these orders being fulfilled within 50 miles of the customers' home. This has been an incredible learning curve for us, and we continue to optimize our regional fulfillment capabilities to deliver faster and at lower cost. 
While our supply chain is moving quickly to support our digital business in real time, rerouting products from the chain to DCs and regional fulfillment stores, our technology team has stood up a 24-hour group to continuously refine the order allocation logic between the fulfillment stores and DCs. Our buying team is rerouting store orders to the regional fulfillment locations and DCs, while at the same time canceling purchase orders and modifying receipt forecasts to reduce store inventory levels. 
On the consumer-facing side, our teams are closely monitoring top sellers and adjusting quickly to get products that our customers need and partnering with our vendors to help keep us in stock and well positioned. I want to thank all of our business partners for their efforts and collaboration during this time. 
This kind of strategic action, innovation has allowed us to quickly implement curbside pickup, which was launched April 1 at buybuy BABY. In the first full week alone, we completed more than 11,000 curbside orders. We're also introducing curbside pickup at our Harmon stores later this week. Also this week, we are rolling our Buy Online, Pick up In-Store at our BABY stores. We are quickly learning how our customers want to shop with us, and we will continue to evolve the process digitally to create a best-in-class experience. Both BOPIS and curbside pickup will be rolled out to our Bed Bath & Beyond stores as a new service offering for our customers where we can safely reopen. These new services were fast tracked during this period and will significantly enhance our fulfillment capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. 
With the vast majority of our stores temporarily closed, our customer-facing digital channels continue to service our customers, and we are seeing online demand grow significantly. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond digital business is seeing net sales growth of more than 90% for the month of April to date, further strengthening our omnichannel strategic direction. This demand is being facilitated by our agile digital and marketing teams who are working together, responding to consumer data, creating newness and freshness across our sites, highlighting items customers need to make it easy to feel at home and communicating important information about changes in store hours and closures as well as safety measures so that our customers are clear on how we are operating and how they can shop with us. 
As the quarantine phase of this pandemic has taken hold, we are seeing consumer purchasing demand focus on categories such as water filtration, air purifiers, vaporizers and humidifiers as well as kitchen electrics, cleaning and coffee needs. Now over the past month, we sold the equivalent of 10 million cups of coffee and 400% loaf bread makers over the last year. And last week, we sold over 100% more vacuums compared to the same period of time last year. 
This action to temporary close our stores has, of course, fundamentally changed the nature of our business in the short to midterm. The impact on our stores is obvious, but this decision affects the entire company. From IT to merchandising, finance to HR, the shape and structure of our business is radically different in this new environment across concepts and across the country. So in this moment, we are taking a holistic approach to managing our financial position, including larger efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen our liquidity. In conjunction with the recent decision to extend the temporary store closures, we implemented several additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of our store associates and a percentage of our corporate associates until at least May 2. Salaries will also reduce for myself and the executive team as well as the Board. We put an immediate stop to $150 million in CapEx spend and put a hold on share repurchases and future dividends. Robyn will provide further detail on our proactive measures in a minute. 
We are balancing our ability to provide jobs and financial support for our associates in the short, medium and long term as well as prioritizing investments designed to strengthen our business. We believe these actions will help us further weather the storm and preserve our financial health for the good of our associates, customers and shareholders. If there is a silver lining, I would say that given the monumental changes we've made to our business over the past 4 weeks, our ability to act decisively, partner up and move with speed and agility has been greatly enhanced. I'm very proud of the ideas, inspiration and commitment that all our associates have made to serve our customers and our business. It's been incredible to come together as one united virtual team across the company to work together in ways perhaps that would have not been possible or even thought of in the past. We are leveraging this learning opportunity to be more collaborative and flexible in our focused priorities and then move more quickly so that we are ready to welcome our customers back when we can safely reopen our stores.
We have also provided much-needed support for local communities, serving food and care packages to seniors, military personnel and their families plus children in need from our Christmas Tree Shops stores across the country. And we've donated more than 0.5 million Easter chocolates, candies, cookies, baskets and toys to dozens of local charities, shelters, schools and community organizations nationwide from over 250 of our Cost Plus World Market stores. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, which just seem like a lifetime ago. In short, the pressures of store traffic trends and heavy promotional activity, coupled with the inventory management issues around the holiday selling period, hampered our efforts to stabilize the business in the fourth quarter. These trends are consistent with the information we provided on February 11 when we issued preliminary financial data for the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. 
Product availability with certain key promotional categories, such as kitchen electrics, leading into the holiday period were either too low or just out of stock. We just didn't have enough of the right stuff, which hurt us. We are confident this is fully rectifiable in terms of our learning plan and implementation from now until the back half of fiscal 2020. 
Our fourth quarter results were also pressured by heavier clearance activity during the quarter as we rapidly actioned on our strategic inventory reduction program. Now we surpassed the halfway mark of this initiative and are pleased with our progress. It's important to note that prior to this current business environment, we were sharpening our focus on inventory, ending the fourth quarter with approximately 16% less retail inventory at cost on an adjusted basis versus a year ago, so operating leaner and on a lower SKU base. We are now focusing our attention on optimizing our merchandising mix, which of course is a key focus for our new Chief Merchant, Joe Hartsig. 
For the full fourth quarter, we also reported a positive shift in sales across our digital channel with a return to strong growth of about 16%. Sales in our mobile channels for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY each grew more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and orders taken through our mobile app were up over 75%. These quarterly results strengthened our resolve to continue to make necessary bold and broad-based changes needed to modernize our business and gives us confidence about our ability to improve upon this quarterly performance. This includes the strategic restructuring program we implemented in late February to reduce annual SG&A expense by approximately $85 million and reset our cost structure. 
Prior to COVID-19, we had solid strategic plans for fiscal 2020. In this moment, we need to be agile and focused on simplifying and strengthening our business where it matters most to our customers and reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Let me now address the issues at hand and what we are working on. First, recruiting talent remains a top priority. We have an extensive interview process underway for the open roles. We have made bold moves. We have a robust process and have identified key candidates, with Joe Hartsig being the first major appointment as our new Chief Merchandising Officer. There will be more news on other great talent to come in the coming weeks. I'm excited to welcome Joe to the team. He has more than 30 years of experience in consumer brand development and retail merchandising with well-known consumer businesses like Walgreens, Walmart, Motorola and SC Johnson. To me, Joe is a merchant's merchant. And I'm looking to him to be a leader and a teacher as we rebuild our business, including improving key items in stocks and improving curation and further differentiation of our assortment, which is our #1 priority. 
Second, we remain focused on generating funds from the sale of assets and simplifying our business. In addition to the previously announced sale-leaseback transaction, we recently sold the One Kings Lane business to a third-party for an undisclosed amount. As previously disclosed, we ended into a definitive agreement to sell our PersonalizationMall.com business to 1-800-FLOWERS for $252 million. 1-800 was required to close the transaction on March 30 but breached its obligation to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require them to close and intend to vigorously enforce our rights. 
While we can make no assurances, we will continue to pursue other portfolio adjustments and evaluate the remaining owned real estate in an effort to create a stronger and more focused portfolio. Lastly and most importantly, we are driving our strategic growth plans. Under the current business environment, we have modified our capital investments, but we'll continue to invest with confidence where it matters most. We now plan to invest about $250 million focusing on our core business and key projects that support the omnichannel future of our company in 2020 and beyond, which are more relevant than ever, such as our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including BOPIS and curbside pickup, omni inventory management as well as digital marketing and personalization. At a high level, we are reengineering our supply chain and our vendor relationships as well as further strengthening our owned brand strategy. We are postponing store remodels due to the coronavirus situation and the timing issues it's created as we don't want to interfere with the critical third and fourth quarter holiday period in 2020. We will also continue to review our store footprint as we have nearly 250 leases that are up for renewal in 2020 alone, which gives us added financial flexibility. 
In technology, we'll continue to invest in order allocation logic to better leverage our stores and fulfillment centers and improve our site speed and checkout experience in addition to simplifying the process. Now we have postponed our plans for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction to preserve our financial position and retain financial flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to longer term, and we will reevaluate when appropriate. Now is the time to stay liquid until we have more clarity on the global situations surrounding COVID-19. All the steps we've taken since I arrived at the company 5 short months ago, including this COVID-19 moment, reinforce our preliminary strategic plan focused on a singular purpose, to make it easy to feel at home. Our strategy will deliver against 5 key pillars, namely product, price, promise, place and people. We believe this strategy is more relevant today than ever and will support significant improvement in our financial performance and a deeper connection with our loyal customers. In this time, when home is even more central to our lives and being safe at home with family is essential, Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home. We will provide inspiration and a curated, affordable assortment so that our customers can create a home they love. 
Now before turning the call over to Robyn, I just wanted to mention that we have previously planned to host an investor event this spring. And now under these circumstances, we are exploring other options, including potentially a virtual event, to take place at a more suitable time. We'll want to introduce you to the new team, showcase some of our new capabilities and early results and lay out our longer-term strategic growth objectives for the business. We'll keep you updated on our plans. 
While we deal with the immediate priorities, we continue our work to drive the company forward. We have robust contingency plans, and I am confident that we are able to navigate this crisis. We have an iconic brand with great consumer brand loyalty, and we're taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with our customers as we strengthen our omni-always approach. I believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger, given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
Robyn will now review our fourth quarter results and then provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures we have taken to date to protect our financial position and maintain flexibility. I will then come back for some closing remarks.

I hope you are all faring well under these very unusual circumstances. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.92 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter includes an unfavorable impact of $0.91 per diluted share for special items, including $41 million in severance costs related to the strategic restructuring program initiated in February 2020 and the extensive leadership changes announced in December 2019; a noncash charge of approximately $35 million for the impairment of certain store level assets; a noncash charge of approximately $33 million for the impairment of certain trade names and other assets; and an expense of $33 million related to the loss on the sale-leaseback transaction announced in January 2020. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.38. 
The remainder of my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, as applicable, consistent with our prior disclosures to better represent year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative period. From this year's fourth quarter, we exclude the items I just mentioned, along with the related impact on the provision for income taxes. And from last year's fourth quarter, we exclude the $510 million pretax goodwill impairment charge and the related impact on the provision for income taxes. 
As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending February 29 and included the Cyber Monday holiday week, while our fourth quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending March 2 and did not include the Cyber Monday holiday week. 
On February 11, we reported preliminary unaudited financial performance data for the first 2 months of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We shared this update to provide visibility into the then current pressures on our business, including store traffic declines, combined with inventory management issues and the impact on revenue and margin resulting from increased promotional activity and markdowns. 
Net sales in the quarter were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 6.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 5.6%, reflecting a high single-digit decline in the number of transactions, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined about 10%, while comp sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 16%. 
Similar to last quarter, our sales in the fourth quarter were positively modified by the calendar shift of the Cyber Monday holiday week. Adjusting for this calendar shift to exclude the Cyber Monday holiday week in both periods, our comp sales for the quarter declined 11%, with a decline in store sales of 13.6% and growth in digital sales of 1.1%. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% of net sales as compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 210 basis point decline was primarily due to an unfavorable impact on merchandise margins from promotional activity and markdowns. In addition, we had an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense due to the higher penetration of digital sales within the total mix of quarterly sales. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was 30.7% of net sales as compared to 28.2% of net sales in the prior year period. This 250 basis point increase in SG&A, in order of magnitude, was primarily due to about 100 basis points of consulting expense associated with our efforts to expedite the ongoing transformation initiatives and review of assets and an increase in advertising expense, including digital marketing, related to the heavy promotional activity in the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effect of fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation on a lower sales base. 
Our quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.3% on an adjusted basis and included $8.3 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. As a result of the lower pretax earnings base in the fourth quarter, these net after-tax benefits have a greater impact on the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year on an adjusted basis was 19.7% and included approximately $8.9 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring in that quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong cash position with about $1.4 billion in cash and investments, including over $250 million in net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed during the quarter. Adjusted retail inventories of $2.1 billion at cost, excluding a charge for markdowns associated with our inventory reduction initiative, reflected a significant reduction of about 16% or over $400 million at cost at the end of the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period. We continue to action against our previously communicated $1 billion inventory reduction program at retail, and we are now about halfway through the program and plan to continue to work down the remaining inventory in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the year were $277 million, with nearly 50% of the expense related to technology projects, primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx expense was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings. We closed 26 stores and opened 2 stores during the quarter. 
Regarding share repurchase activity, there were no open market repurchases during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have suspended repurchasing of our shares while conducting the review of our retail portfolio and real estate assets. The company currently remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to long term and will reevaluate when appropriate. To clarify, our previously announced first quarter dividend was paid on April 14 and was not impacted by the temporary suspension. 
Moving on to fiscal 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will of course be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. We're monitoring the situation closely regarding our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. 
We ended fiscal 2019 with cash and investments of $1.4 billion. And while we feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we plan to take or are taking proactive steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, such as drawing down the additional $236 million of available funds remaining from our revolving credit facility; suspended our plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction; postponed $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020, including some store remodels; furloughed the majority of our workforce, including store and corporate associates, until at least May 2; temporarily reduce the salaries of our executive team, including myself and Mark, by 30%; temporarily reduced the quarterly cash compensation of our independent Board of Directors by 30%; reducing discretionary spend, such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with maintenance of stores that are temporarily closed; renegotiating extensions of payment terms for goods and services and rents; managing to lower inventory levels; and implementing applicable benefits of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. 
Considering these circumstances, while we have trimmed CapEx by $150 million, we are now prioritizing approximately $250 million in essential capital expenditures to drive our strategic growth plans, as Mark described a few minutes ago. In addition, our capital structure provides further flexibility, including the potential to utilize significant balance sheet assets to generate incremental liquidity if needed. As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we had approximately $2 billion of quality, primarily nonseasonal inventory on our balance sheet, which has not been pledged as collateral under our existing debt arrangements. These actions, together with our strategic efforts to reset the organization's cost structure including the recent restructuring program and our strong balance sheet, put us in a better position to manage through this period of uncertainty. We remain committed to keeping our shareholders informed about the business and our strategy to reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Now I would like to provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the full impact of this situation won't be known for months. However, what's important right now is that we are proactively managing the immediate challenges and playing an important role for our customers. As of Friday, March 20, we had temporarily closed over 50% of our stores across all banners until April 3. The approximately 700 stores that remained open in operation were stores that sell essential items such as health care, personal care, infant care, cleaning supplies or food and beverages. The following week, the company announced that it was temporarily closing all retail banners across the U.S. and Canada other than buybuy BABY and Harmon stores, subject to state and local regulations. This left about 170 of our 1,500 stores in operation to provide the essential items we sell to customers. On April 2, we extended the temporary store closures until May 2. 
For the month of March, while we have not yet finalized our monthly results, we do have visibility to our sales performance. For the March period, we are able to share preliminary unaudited financial performance data. Overall, net sales across all banners were down approximately 31% versus the prior year March period. This was led by a decline of about 41% in store sales, as expected, due to less customer in-store shopping, resulting from self-quarantine guidelines and the initiation of temporary store closures and limited store hours. 
Net sales from our digital channels, however, were strong in March, up about 16%, benefiting from an increase in digital shopping due to COVID-19 and further enhancements we have made in our fulfillment capabilities, including converting about 25% of our temporary closed stores to regional fulfillment stores, as Mark spoke about earlier. 
The sales performance for both buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores, which remain open to provide essential items, was better than the overall company for the March period. 
Through the first 2 weeks of April, the fiscal quarter-to-date overall decline in our total net sales is around 42%, primarily due to the additional temporary store closures. However, net sales from our digital channels have further strengthened with year-over-year growth of more than 35%. Due to the level of market uncertainty, we will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time. As we work through 2020, we believe our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. Our strong cash position, along with our near-term actions, provide the company with continued financial resilience and ample short and midterm liquidity to fund the operations of the business. To reiterate what Mark said earlier, we do believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger, given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet.

And I think four-wall profitability and location and needs really do change going forward, and we'll have ongoing data to look at that more deeply. So that's work in flight. We're not ready to share that yet. We're still doing an assessment, and the situation is very fluid.

Look, I mean, Michael, on the opening, no crystal ball here for Mark Tritton. But here's what I would say to you. We are -- we've moved from a now to a next to a future proposition in terms of our strategic planning. And while we are securing our current scenario and managing our teams, we are working on the reemergence and the reentry into the market and how that plays out. We don't have that time down, but we have multiple scenarios. We really tapped into major groups like [ Reeler ], who are doing a fantastic job in terms of sharing data and working with government to establish what reentry looks like. And to your point, Michael, I do think that it will be a region-by-region-based response. We'll be part of a bevy of retailers that follow the guidelines of government and come back into the market only when it's safe for our teams and our customers, and we're following those guidelines strictly. 
Now when that is, we factored in our financial models on multiple scenarios, including a very elongated period. We feel really comfortable in terms of our cash burn and our liquidity as a result without touching any further available funds. And so we've looked at the map, and we've looked at the time frame. The actual date we will be ready -- and as we've talked about, we've already accelerated a number of capabilities during this downtime like BOPIS, like curbside pickup and like store fulfill that we think are actually going to really sustain and benefit our total business, including the digital -- great digital growth we've been seeing through the fourth quarter and now into Q1.

I know you just said that, look, you obviously do have a lot of cash on the books, additional liquidity. You said you've taken through multiple scenarios where even on a long-dated basis, you're pretty comfortable. But could you give a little more detail in terms of what the time line is? And given the things that you've done like probably getting concessions on rents, furloughing 80% of the labor force, halting some CapEx, all those things, it's got to put you in at least a reasonable position to manage. So any more detail on that is important.

Look, I mean, that's why we're sharing a lot of these points. Liquidity is definitely there, and we took really early steps to control our costs and move forward. I mean to kind of lean into a little bit more, Curt, I would tell you that while we've been still working on the exit towards furlough and the negotiations, we're immediately able to cap off more than 40% of our weekly cash burn rate immediately. And we're implementing further plans through based on what Robyn and I shared. So we've got strong controls there. Our modeling, we, like everybody, and I mean we've been talking to our financial advisers as well as [ Reeler ] and the people I shared with, we've looked at an April scenario and a May scenario and an August scenario and an indefinite scenario. And in all of those, we've got really clear math about our sustainability and liquidity plus the availability to draw down on other facilities. So we've got control of cash burn, we have cash, and we have a plan. 
Now this is not something that is years and years and years in the making. I think everyone is looking at this in these very short synapses but also looking at the worst-case scenarios. When we sat down with our Board and shared our worst-case scenarios, we have good liquidity, and we have stability in our business with the right actions taken to take us through. And I think we're in a really unusual position, Curt, in that we don't have rotting fruit in terms of our merchandise. We're primarily seasonless. We're not an apparel business, and we have sustainable product that we can leverage upon reentry, and we're not going to be in a blood bath in terms of cost. 
So there are some real benefits to this space. And there's no doubt that the home business has become very fruitful in this period. We just need the customers to be able to access us and other retailers and products in a more fluid way, which is an omnichannel environment of true digital and physical stores.

Some of it was self-inflicted. I mean when we don't have best sellers in stock, we've got discounting and we don't have our inventory. I mean some of the sales decline we saw in our stores wasn't necessarily traffic. We did some intel work on that, saw the customers were coming in, and they just couldn't find the product in stock. So we were shooting ourselves in the foot. That is easily rectifiable, and we started to do that straight at the end of January. We saw positive comps coming through or more positive comps in terms of churn rate in February. And as we stated, we saw an acceleration of our digital business. It was doing well during the period, but that accelerated even further. So we've been seeing our full year '19 business, we were about 19% penetration in digital in total. For the fourth quarter alone, that was up to 21.3%, and we had double-digit comps there. Now we've seen that digital business even more deeply accelerate with a lot of new customers, about 31%, 33% of our customers in this Q1 period being new to the Bed Bath & Beyond websites, buybuy BABY websites, et cetera. So we're garnering new business, and we're building plans with BOPIS, curbside and personalization to sustain those relationships. 
So we're excited, if that's a word I can even use in this moment, about what lies ahead. But it definitely was some gentle momentum coming our way that was positive in February that belied the December-January trends. And then we hit this moment.

So I'm not going to provide the total number, but I just shared, Simeon, like Q4, we're at 21.3% of total sales. And so we're getting that digital engagement and follow through with the customer. What we've seen is these very sharp synapses. And one of the things that Robyn was outlining is the periods in which we were partially open then closed and then -- particularly in Bed Bath and then relying heavily on the digital business. We've seen strong conversion. It's never going to map out to be full coverage of our stores-based business. But we are seeing both demand and total sales in the 70%, 80% and 90% mark when we move into the April period. And as we mentioned, really ramping up and flexing with agility our capability to fulfill those orders, both in the stores that we're using as regional fulfillment centers as well as our DCs, have been tremendous. So we're meeting guest needs. We're working with them. We're fulfilling orders. We're working through our inventory, and we're building equity in our omni-always business.

I think our mix is very fluid at the moment. I'm -- clearly, people are leaning into cleaning, into kitchen, into baking, into home care. And so this is a great time for us. Our textile business is not as strong, and that's something that we see coming forward as people look to refresh their home. We think this is going to be -- if people have been staring at the same 4 walls for a month or 2 now, Simeon, I think the idea of refreshing your bathroom, your bedroom, your kitchen, that's going to be pivotal in terms of some of the engagement of customers and how they return into the market more than maybe an apparel purchase or definitely a travel purchase. 
So discretionary spending, I think, will be focused, and we may be a strong beneficiary there. So margin is balanced. And what we see is that our digital business always performs at a much lower coupon rate. And therefore, at this point, we're getting a really balanced response there. I think that the -- we see online acceleration. I think there are a lot of people who are talking around that. And I think the great thing about that is that -- some of the changes we've most recently made in terms of fulfillment and support. I mean not having BOPIS versus the rest of the industry has been an Achilles' heel. We were set to launch that in full in May in stores, and we've maintained that spend and commitment to be ready when our doors do open. And then have also added in curbside. And now we've stood up store fulfill, which was something that we had on our agenda, but we wanted to get through the other pieces first. We've accelerated those. And as you talked about that in terms of the impact, I'm no stranger with previous employers on the margin mix that a store fulfill via order or BOPIS can do in terms of the math and the margin on digital. So we'll start to model that out. 
Now is not the time to get accurate about that, but we believe that's positive things that lie ahead for us. And then we've already begun to convert some discretionary merchandise into more of an owned brand platform ahead of a major relaunch in 2021 at the start. So we'll see some margin benefits for those products in the back end, the digital fulfill benefits in the back end.

Look, I mean I think that we entered into promotional activity in a way that we hadn't ever before, Seth. I think that if we go back to the end of the third quarter, start of the fourth quarter, it was the first time we'd ever really been truly promotional out by the coupon. And we really didn't lay down the plans to get there in the right way. So we burn the margin and we burn a lot of inventory and weren't prepared to get back into stock. So they're kind of tough learnings. But they're also redeemable moments that we can translate into new actions. 
I think that the one thing that I've noticed coming into the business and have been working with the team on is the role of value and price/value equation. I think that we know that customers don't want to do the math, and they want to have simple, readable affordability. And I think that's what we're missing from our equation. Both in-store and online, we haven't been making value. And I don't mean just sharp price. 
I mean the -- resonating true value to the customer has been a little bit difficult in places than how we've operated. And so we've learned a ton of what not to do. And as a result, you're going to see coming through in our digital channel a refresh of how we're presenting value and talking to our guests with clarity and simplicity. You'll see that roll through circulars. And then when we open up, you'll start to see it manifest in things like end caps and price point presentation, a real clear, understandable everyday value. So we -- there's no doubt that as we come out of this COVID-19 moment and with unemployment and some tough times ahead, customers want to be able to get value, see value, understand value and have it resonate with them quickly. And we think we've got some great plans in place to really step into that. And that doesn't mean giving away the margin farm. It just means being really clear on our intent upfront.

The major one really there, Seth, is around the store remodel programs. I've been working on -- since I joined on a program with the team, we've got 3 test stores that are showing really positive signs of growth from the core model, and that was without any assortment changes. Just -- and any of the price point changes and clarity that we talked about. So refreshment of the stores is something we then fast tracked. And we're ready to roll out 25, 26 stores to really give us a model to accelerate our spend in subsequent years. Now that was going to take place and be ready on or before the beginning of the Back to College period so we didn't interrupt with our key selling period. And then in Q3, Q4, we would have been done. 
Having to ice those at the moment was really tough because we had some good work that we wanted to put into play. But it would have been crazy to spend that money, disrupt Q3 and Q4 and wanting to preserve some CapEx. So we've got the plans. We've got the info, and we've got the dream.

Look, I mean, a couple of things there. I think that we've been -- Joe has been leading the charge here and having deep conversation with all our majors and our general vendor bases about flow. If you go back to the inventory position that we had, there's kind of 2 things going there. The good news was that overall, we reduced our inventory by about 16% at the close of the quarter. And so we were working leaner on that. But inside of that, we did have big misses. Not by having more inventory. We think that's a good level that we can come down to. But we could have traded some of our mix to be more in stock about key items and generated more sales and gross margin by having the right merchandise. So again, the level coming down is a positive, the curation within the level becomes critical. Joe has really lend into that charge, getting it back in stock about top 100, 250, 500 items and making sure that we can draw that down. I think also getting the flexibility to draw the stock from different places helps us to kind of speed up sales and get clarity and delivery to the customer on time. 
In terms of the point around the commitments, we quickly moved into an evaluation of high-risk merchandise, seasonal merchandise and anything that kind of -- if we looked at our long-term plan of what could have been a close at hold, really looking at minimizing our quantification of risk and adjusting flow. So that's a very fluid discussion, a very real discussion. And that began on day 1 when we started to see the problem emerge. So it's a real strength in having Joe on board, focusing on this. And our overall inventory plans are really highlighted by being in stock of best sellers, getting our preplan with our vendors in place so that we could get that in stock and we play out the third and fourth quarter in a different way and then keeping a close eye on seasonality and flow of merchandise from offshore vendors.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I think in general, in the industry, the consensus that I've been seeing, Jonathan, is that everyone is planning for -- I mean this is not going to be a light switch moment where everything goes back to the immediate moment. We have got -- our financial plans are very conservative when I talked about the modeling in terms of an expectation of a highly reduced sales level so that we can work out our financial plan to be as liquid as possible no matter what. And so there's a number of percentages being bandied around there. I'm not going to contribute to the dialogue other than to say we have multiple scenarios, and some of them quite deep, to ensure that we've got our liquidity in place even if the return is there. 
Our general -- I think there's going to be different rules here. I think you've got to remember that -- I think that this is -- we're looking at a lot of the recessionary moments from the past as models. But you also have the fear factor of safety inside piece. And So large gatherings, shopping at the mall, those things become more questionable maybe for others. So less than 10% of our fleet is mall-based. We're big box, and we're independent. We think that will work in our favor, and that helps us to do things like curbside pickup and the fluidity of BOPIS much faster than maybe a mall-based retailer. And we think there'll be a gradual turn on, but we also think there will be categories that come back faster. And I think that home will be a beneficiary much faster than apparel. And we think that there's some positive upside to establishing relationships and transactions with customers early, but we know it's going to be graded.

I know your background is merchandising, and you just brought Joe on board. I guess could you talk about how much you think that the assortment in the store needs to change as you think about the next few years? And what areas you think you can most quickly address here potentially even this year?",Bradley Thomas,47285801.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Look, I mean we've already identified and are moving forward on those strategies. So that remains unchanged with this moment, and I want to be really clear around that. A couple of things there, Brad. I think the first thing that we noticed, and we just talked about value earlier on the call, is that we have some real gaps in opening price point and the clarity of communication around value to our customers. So we're leaning into that space. I think the second piece is around really reducing a high level of duplication in items. And we really want to focus on a curation of differentiation and relevance to our customer. And where we've done that, we've seen real wins. In some of these stores that I was talking about earlier that I was playing with the models on, we've reduced the SKU count by 20% to 30%, and we were seeing double-digit comps at the same time. So when we curate, we make our assortment more focused and understandable. 
And then I've just been working even today on -- with Joe on a number of really great owned brands that we're cultivating and getting ready to launch at the start of next fiscal year because these things take time, and we're developing newness there, which will help reframe out each of the key rooms and categories and occasions that we are currently dominant in and have strong market share but also ones where we want to cultivate. So I think that there's a modernity and a freshness and a relevance and an affordability in that home and personal care space as well as our efforts inside BABY, which were well underway. That can really create more relevant merchandise assortment. So we're upturning a lot of rocks there. We're renegotiating costs across the board, which had already been done and worked on. 
So there's a margin upside. There's a mix upside, and then there's a perception upside, including value, that we see coming. And that will be evolutionary throughout the rest of 2020, and you're really going to see some strong green shoots in late 2020, early 2021.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It's a great question. I mean, look, I mean I think we really would have been hitting on some high double-digit comps. And I think that we had to restrain some demand based on availability of inventory, especially in key items. And so those items are strong. They're not markdown-driven. That would have been a real boom for us, Seth. And I think that bodes well for where we can cut and paste those experiences into benefits in third and fourth quarter in 2020. 
The upside of it, I think, is also going to be distorted by the current behavior in COVID-19. And that's why I'm really excited about the fact that we've built background capabilities very quickly to sustain that as the total market opens back up. And then we've been seeing where we have really changed the cadence of our communication dialogue and the way we've set up our digital website to be more relevant to weekly guest needs. We're really connecting with customers and driving high double-digit comps in those categories that we're leading into and building real engagement and data with these customers. So I think it's too early to say how high is high. I think the industry in total believes that penetration rates will be increased. We're already on that pathway. And when I'm saying 21% of our business in Q4 was already digital, we see a lot of upside in that, but we also want to balance out that with growth in our stores.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I mean bread makers, blenders and vacuums and cleaning products, water filtration, coffee, coffee, coffee, like -- people like, hell, just going to make the best of it at home. Now that's a boom for us. And we think -- we actually think that as people come out at this moment, we think that some of the data that we're seeing very early, and it's preliminary, there's going to be some discretionary spend move away from specific categories. 
But we believe that people will want to celebrate their home, reinforce it, refresh it, invite friends for smaller moments and build equity in entertaining and start to celebrate the home. And then leading into a Back to College moment, which we're really primed, which is your home away from home, we're really ready to take on that. So I think this kind of new cocooning, new nesting, new love for home and valuing the environment -- while we all want to step outside, clearly, I think there's going to be safety as a consideration. And I think there's going to be a love and respect for the home that we're ready to take advantage of.

I think that was one of the first things that Joe and team and Robyn really worked on, was like, hey, great partners, this is going to be tough when we all know we're in a situation we know we're going to be in for the long term. We know we're liquid. We know we're strong, and we have a plan, and just let everybody work together on what we can do here. And so without going into great detail, know that those conversations were very robust, and we've asked for a level of support. It's just short to midterm. It's not the standard way we'll operate. And we'll all work on it together. And we've seen some really good lean-ins there to change that liquidity. And as I said, some of the burn rates we talked about earlier were not inclusive of those actions taking hold yet. So that's a further benefit to cash flow. 
But yes, look, it was on our to-do list very early on, and we began in earnest to sit with our partners and renegotiate just in the short to mid how we can play with terms and how we can work.

As Janet said, we are coming together tonight from remote locations, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us under these unprecedented circumstances. 
Frankly, it seems like a different place and time. Life as we knew it before March is a distant memory. We are in the moment now, and I'd like to start by discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll talk about the strategic actions we are taking in this moment to build momentum around our transformation plans. Then Robyn will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide some further context around the potential impacts from the pandemic. 
Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers and our teams. We are providing essential infant, health and personal care items to local communities through our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores as well as serving the rest of our loyal customers online through our digital channels. Our teams are working around the clock to provide these essential products to our customers and to ensure the supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible. I would like to take a minute to personally thank our associate teams on behalf of management and the Board. We thank you for your above-and-beyond service, attitude and dedication to our company and our loyal customers despite this extremely challenging situation. Making it easy to feel at home means different things to different people, and our teams have been working incredibly hard to support our customers. I also want to say thank you to our loyal customers and assure you that we will continue to work hard to help you access the essential products we sell as you manage through these very difficult times. 
In this moment, we are focused on facilitating and coordinating our ongoing response to the current pandemic. There is no historical playbook for this situation, but we have a remarkable team, robust contingency plans and a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to navigate this unprecedented challenge with confidence. We quickly initiated our contingency plan, creating an essential response unit with emergency task force groups to focus on several priority areas, including our people, operations, customers, technology and our finances. While this situation is like nothing we've seen before, we are adapting as necessary and taking decisive actions to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers and strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. This is an important time for us now and moving forward. Bed Bath & Beyond can play an important role in supporting customers and their families in making it easy to feel at home. 
All but approximately 170 of our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores are now temporarily closed at least until May 2. We continue to provide essential products such as infant, health and personal care items in store, subject to state and local regulations, and online through our various digital channels. We are rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. They are relying on us more than ever to deliver essential products directly to their home. 
All 4 of our e-commerce fulfillment centers are currently operating. And by the end of this week, we will have converted approximately 25% of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers to use our vast inventory resources to assign orders locally and deliver quickly. 
With these conversions, we expanded our fulfillment capacity significantly. The regional fulfillment stores have doubled the capacity of our entire fulfillment network, facilitating approximately 44% of our overall daily orders with almost 40% of these orders being fulfilled within 50 miles of the customers' home. This has been an incredible learning curve for us, and we continue to optimize our regional fulfillment capabilities to deliver faster and at lower cost. 
While our supply chain is moving quickly to support our digital business in real time, rerouting products from the chain to DCs and regional fulfillment stores, our technology team has stood up a 24-hour group to continuously refine the order allocation logic between the fulfillment stores and DCs. Our buying team is rerouting store on orders to the regional fulfillment locations and DCs while at the same time canceling purchase orders and modifying receipt forecasts to reduce store inventory levels. 
On the consumer-facing side, our teams are closely monitoring top sellers and adjusting quickly to get products that our customers need and partnering with our vendors to help keep us in stock and well positioned. I want to thank all of our business partners for their efforts and collaboration during this time. 
This kind of strategic action and innovation has allowed us to quickly implement curbside pickup, which was launched April 1 at buybuy BABY. In the first full week alone, we completed more than 11,000 curbside orders. We're also introducing curbside pickup at our Harmon stores later this week. Also this week, we are rolling our Buy Online Pick Up In Store at our BABY stores. We are quickly learning how our customers want to shop with us, and we will continue to evolve the process digitally to create a best-in-class experience. Both BOPIS and curbside pickup will be rolled out to our Bed Bath & Beyond stores as a new service offering for our customers where we can safely reopen. These new services were fast tracked during this period and will significantly enhance our fulfillment capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. 
With the vast majority of our stores temporarily closed, our customer-facing digital channels continue to service our customers, and we are seeing online demand grow significantly. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond digital business is seeing net sales growth of more than 90% for the month of April to date, further strengthening our omnichannel strategic direction. This demand is being facilitated by our agile digital and marketing teams who are working together, responding to consumer data, creating newness and freshness across our sites, highlighting items customers need to make it easy to feel at home and communicating important information about changes in store hours and closures as well as safety measures so that our customers are clear on how we are operating and how they can shop with us. 
As the quarantine phase of this pandemic has taken hold, we are seeing consumer purchasing demand focus on categories such as water filtration, air purifiers, vaporizers and humidifiers as well as kitchen electrics, cleaning and coffee needs. Now over the past month, we sold the equivalent of 10 million cups of coffee and 400% loaf bread makers over the last year. And last week, we sold over 100% more vacuums compared to the same period of time last year. 
This action to temporary close our stores has, of course, fundamentally changed the nature of our business in the short to midterm. The impact on our stores is obvious, but this decision affects the entire company. From IT to merchandising, finance to HR, the shape and structure of our business is radically different in this new environment across concepts and across the country. 
So in this moment, we are taking a holistic approach to managing our financial position, including larger efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen our liquidity. In conjunction with the recent decision to extend the temporary store closures, we implemented several additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of our store associates and a percentage of our corporate associates until at least May 2. Salaries will also reduce for myself and the executive team as well as the Board. We put an immediate stop to $150 million in CapEx spend and put a hold on share repurchases and future dividends. Robyn will provide further detail on our proactive measures in a minute. 
We are balancing our ability to provide jobs and financial support for our associates in the short, medium and long term as well as prioritizing investments designed to strengthen our business. We believe these actions will help us further weather the storm and preserve our financial health for the good of our associates, customers and shareholders. 
If there is a silver lining, I would say that given the monumental changes we've made to our business over the past 4 weeks, our ability to act decisively, partner up and move with speed and agility has been greatly enhanced. I'm very proud of the ideas, inspiration and commitment that all our associates have made to serve our customers and our business. It's been incredible to come together as one united virtual team across the company to work together in ways perhaps that would have not been possible or even thought of in the past. We are leveraging this learning opportunity to be more collaborative and flexible in our focused priorities and then move more quickly so that we are ready to welcome our customers back when we can safely reopen our stores.
We have also provided much-needed support for local communities, serving food and care packages to seniors, military personnel and their families plus children in need from our Christmas Tree Shops stores across the country. And we've donated more than 0.5 million Easter chocolates, candies, cookies, baskets and toys to dozens of local charities, shelters, schools and community organizations nationwide from over 250 of our Cost Plus World Market stores. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, which just seem like a lifetime ago. In short, the pressures of store traffic trends and heavy promotional activity, coupled with the inventory management issues around the holiday selling period, hampered our efforts to stabilize the business in the fourth quarter. These trends are consistent with the information we provided on February 11 when we issued preliminary financial data for the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. 
Product availability with certain key promotional categories, such as kitchen electrics, leading into the holiday period were either too low or just out of stock. We just didn't have enough of the right stuff, which hurt us. We are confident this is fully rectifiable in terms of our learning plan and implementation from now until the back half of fiscal 2020. 
Our fourth quarter results were also pressured by heavier clearance activity during the quarter as we rapidly actioned on our strategic inventory reduction program. Now we surpassed the halfway mark of this initiative and are pleased with our progress. It's important to note that prior to this current business environment, we were sharpening our focus on inventory, ending the fourth quarter with approximately 16% less retail inventory at cost on an adjusted basis versus a year ago so operating leaner and on a lower SKU base. We are now focusing our attention on optimizing our merchandising mix, which of course is a key focus for our new Chief Merchant, Joe Hartsig. 
For the full fourth quarter, we also reported a positive shift in sales across our digital channel with a return to strong growth of about 16%. Sales in our mobile channels for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY each grew more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and orders taken through our mobile app were up over 75%. These quarterly results strengthened our resolve to continue to make necessary bold and broad-based changes needed to modernize our business and gives us confidence about our ability to improve upon this quarterly performance. This includes the strategic restructuring program we implemented in late February to reduce annual SG&A expense by approximately $85 million and reset our cost structure. 
Prior to COVID-19, we had solid strategic plans for fiscal 2020. In this moment, we need to be agile and focused on simplifying and strengthening our business where it matters most to our customers and reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Let me now address the issues at hand and what we are working on. First, recruiting talent remains a top priority. We have an extensive interview process underway for the open roles. We have made bold moves. We have a robust process and have identified key candidates, with Joe Hartsig being the first major appointment as our new Chief Merchandising Officer. There will be more news on other great talent to come in the coming weeks. I'm excited to welcome Joe to the team. He has more than 30 years of experience in consumer brand development and retail merchandising with well-known consumer businesses like Walgreens, Walmart, Motorola and SC Johnson. To me, Joe is a merchant's merchant. And I'm looking to him to be a leader and a teacher as we rebuild our business, including improving key items in stocks and improving curation and further differentiation of our assortment, which is our #1 priority. 
Second, we remain focused on generating funds from the sale of assets and simplifying our business. In addition to the previously announced sale-leaseback transaction, we recently sold the One Kings Lane business to a third party for an undisclosed amount. As previously disclosed, we ended into a definitive agreement to sell our PersonalizationMall.com business to 1-800-FLOWERS for $252 million. 1-800 was required to close the transaction on March 30 but breached its obligation to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require them to close and intend to vigorously enforce our rights. While we can make no assurances, we will continue to pursue other portfolio adjustments and evaluate the remaining owned real estate in an effort to create a stronger and more focused portfolio. 
Lastly and most importantly, we are driving our strategic growth plans. Under the current business environment, we have modified our capital investments, but we'll continue to invest with confidence where it matters most. We now plan to invest about $250 million focusing on our core business and key projects that support the omnichannel future of our company in 2020 and beyond, which are more relevant than ever, such as our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including BOPIS and curbside pickup, omni inventory management as well as digital marketing and personalization. At a high level, we are reengineering our supply chain and our vendor relationships as well as further strengthening our owned-brand strategy. We are postponing store remodels due to the coronavirus situation and the timing issues it's created as we don't want to interfere with the critical third and fourth quarter holiday period in 2020. We will also continue to review our store footprint as we have nearly 250 leases that are up for renewal in 2020 alone, which gives us added financial flexibility. In technology, we'll continue to invest in order allocation logic to better leverage our stores and fulfillment centers and improve our site speed and checkout experience in addition to simplifying the process. 
Now we have postponed our plans for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction to preserve our financial position and retain financial flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to longer term, and we will reevaluate when appropriate. Now is the time to stay liquid until we have more clarity on the global situations surrounding COVID-19. All the steps we've taken since I arrived at the company 5 short months ago, including this COVID-19 moment, reinforce our preliminary strategic plan focused on a singular purpose, to make it easy to feel at home. Our strategy will deliver against 5 key pillars, namely product, price, promise, place and people. We believe this strategy is more relevant today than ever and will support significant improvement in our financial performance and a deeper connection with our loyal customers. In this time, when home is even more central to our lives and being safe at home with family is essential, Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home. We will provide inspiration and a curated, affordable assortment so that our customers can create a home they love. 
Now before turning the call over to Robyn, I just wanted to mention that we have previously planned to host an investor event this spring. And now under these circumstances, we are exploring other options, including potentially a virtual event, to take place at a more suitable time. We'll want to introduce you to the new team, showcase some of our new capabilities and early results and lay out our longer-term strategic growth objectives for the business. We'll keep you updated on our plans. 
While we deal with the immediate priorities, we continue our work to drive the company forward. We have robust contingency plans, and I am confident that we are able to navigate this crisis. We have an iconic brand with great consumer brand loyalty, and we're taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with our customers as we strengthen our omni-always approach. I believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
Robyn will now review our fourth quarter results and then provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures we have taken to date to protect our financial position and maintain flexibility. I will then come back for some closing remarks.

78332623,660410850,321778,48,1,19034876,hdfs://nameservice1/prod/bdp/data/transcripts/event_to_object_to_event_type/landing/2022-10-03/EventToObjectToEventType.txt20221001203636,2022-10-03,1955547,1,5,2020-04-16 11:32:53,5039,76805751,3,2,363007,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all faring well under these very unusual circumstances. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.92 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter includes an unfavorable impact of $0.91 per diluted share for special items, including $41 million in severance costs related to the strategic restructuring program initiated in February 2020 and the extensive leadership changes announced in December 2019; a noncash charge of approximately $35 million for the impairment of certain store level assets; a noncash charge of approximately $33 million for the impairment of certain trade names and other assets; and an expense of $33 million related to the loss on the sale-leaseback transaction announced in January 2020. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.38. 
The remainder of my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, as applicable, consistent with our prior disclosures to better represent year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative period. From this year's fourth quarter, we exclude the items I just mentioned, along with the related impact on the provision for income taxes. And from last year's fourth quarter, we exclude the $510 million pretax goodwill impairment charge and the related impact on the provision for income taxes. As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending February 29 and included the Cyber Monday holiday week, while our fourth quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending March 2 and did not include the Cyber Monday holiday week. 
On February 11, we reported preliminary unaudited financial performance data for the first 2 months of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We shared this update to provide visibility into the then current pressures on our business, including store traffic declines, combined with inventory management issues and the impact on revenue and margin resulting from increased promotional activity and markdowns. 
Net sales in the quarter were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 6.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 5.6%, reflecting a high single-digit decline in the number of transactions partially offset by a low single-digit increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined about 10%, while comp sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 16%. Similar to last quarter, our sales in the fourth quarter were positively modified by the calendar shift of the Cyber Monday holiday week. Adjusting for this calendar shift to exclude the Cyber Monday holiday week in both periods, our comp sales for the quarter declined 11%, with a decline in store sales of 13.6% and growth in digital sales of 1.1%. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% of net sales as compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 210 basis point decline was primarily due to an unfavorable impact on merchandise margins from promotional activity and markdowns. In addition, we had an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense due to the higher penetration of digital sales within the total mix of quarterly sales. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was 30.7% of net sales as compared to 28.2% of net sales in the prior year period. This 250 basis point increase in SG&A, in order of magnitude, was primarily due to about 100 basis points of consulting expense associated with our efforts to expedite the ongoing transformation initiatives and review of assets and an increase in advertising expense, including digital marketing, related to the heavy promotional activity in the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effect of fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation on a lower sales base. 
Our quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.3% on an adjusted basis and included $8.3 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. As a result of the lower pretax earnings base in the fourth quarter, these net after-tax benefits have a greater impact on the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year on an adjusted basis was 19.7% and included approximately $8.9 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring in that quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong cash position with about $1.4 billion in cash and investments, including over $250 million in net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed during the quarter. Adjusted retail inventories of $2.1 billion at cost, excluding a charge for markdowns associated with our inventory reduction initiative, reflected a significant reduction of about 16% or over $400 million at cost at the end of the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period. We continue to action against our previously communicated $1 billion inventory reduction program at retail, and we are now about halfway through the program and plan to continue to work down the remaining inventory in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the year were $277 million, with nearly 50% of the expense related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx expense was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings. We closed 26 stores and opened 2 stores during the quarter. 
Regarding share repurchase activity, there were no open market repurchases during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have suspended repurchasing of our shares while conducting the review of our retail portfolio and real estate assets. The company currently remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to long term and will reevaluate when appropriate. To clarify, our previously announced first quarter dividend was paid on April 14 and was not impacted by the temporary suspension. 
Moving on to fiscal 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will, of course, be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. We're monitoring the situation closely regarding our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. 
We ended fiscal 2019 with cash and investments of $1.4 billion. And while we feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we plan to take or are taking proactive steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, such as drawing down the additional $236 million of available funds remaining from our revolving credit facility; suspended our plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction; postponed $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020, including some store remodels; furloughed the majority of our workforce, including store and corporate associates, until at least May 2; temporarily reduce the salaries of our executive team, including myself and Mark, by 30%; temporarily reduced the quarterly cash compensation of our independent Board of Directors by 30%; reducing discretionary spend, such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with maintenance of stores that are temporarily closed; renegotiating extensions of payment terms for goods and services and rents; managing to lower inventory levels; and implementing applicable benefits of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. 
Considering these circumstances, while we have trimmed CapEx by $150 million, we are now prioritizing approximately $250 million in essential capital expenditures to drive our strategic growth plans, as Mark described a few minutes ago. In addition, our capital structure provides further flexibility, including the potential to utilize significant balance sheet assets to generate incremental liquidity if needed. As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we had approximately $2 billion of quality, primarily nonseasonal inventory on our balance sheet, which has not been pledged as collateral under our existing debt arrangements. These actions, together with our strategic efforts to reset the organization's cost structure including the recent restructuring program and our strong balance sheet, put us in a better position to manage through this period of uncertainty. We remain committed to keeping our shareholders informed about the business and our strategy to reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Now I would like to provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the full impact of this situation won't be known for months. However, what's important right now is that we are proactively managing the immediate challenges and playing an important role for our customers. As of Friday, March 20, we had temporarily closed over 50% of our stores across all banners until April 3. The approximately 700 stores that remained open in operation were stores that sell essential items such as health care, personal care, infant care, cleaning supplies or food and beverages. The following week, the company announced that it was temporarily closing all retail banners across the U.S. and Canada other than buybuy BABY and Harmon stores, subject to state and local regulations. This left about 170 of our 1,500 stores in operation to provide the essential items we sell to customers. On April 2, we extended the temporary store closures until May 2. 
For the month of March, while we have not yet finalized our monthly results, we do have visibility to our sales performance. For the March period, we are able to share preliminary unaudited financial performance data. Overall, net sales across all banners were down approximately 31% versus the prior year March period. This was led by a decline of about 41% in store sales, as expected, due to less customer in-store shopping, resulting from self-quarantine guidelines and the initiation of temporary store closures and limited store hours. Net sales from our digital channels, however, were strong in March, up about 16%, benefiting from an increase in digital shopping due to COVID-19 and further enhancements we have made in our fulfillment capabilities, including converting about 25% of our temporary closed stores to regional fulfillment stores, as Mark spoke about earlier. The sales performance for both buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores, which remain open to provide essential items, was better than the overall company for the March period. 
Through the first 2 weeks of April, the fiscal quarter-to-date overall decline in our total net sales is around 42% primarily due to the additional temporary store closures. However, net sales from our digital channels have further strengthened with year-over-year growth of more than 35%. Due to the level of market uncertainty, we will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time. 
As we work through 2020, we believe our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. Our strong cash position, along with our near-term actions, provide the company with continued financial resilience and ample short and midterm liquidity to fund the operations of the business. To reiterate what Mark said earlier, we do believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet.

And we will continually look for ways to optimize our business model, whether through the supply chain or through other operating efficiencies across the business. We'll also take advantage of the market dislocation that has already occurred and that will likely to continue, resulting in changes in the competitive landscape and opportunities for us to grow market share in the home, baby and personal care spaces. This time has been a test for all retailers. We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is positioned to come out stronger as we have the cash, the talent, the right plans and great, loyal customers.

I think, Bobby, this is a really fluid moment, and we are really pleased with the work we've done to date. What Robyn's outlined earlier is in terms of the compensation decisions, the renegotiation on terms, managing receipt flow, postponing CapEx and the suspension on shares and repurchases. I mean we've got hundreds of millions of dollars that we've saved. So our cash burn to date has been controlled, and we're really happy with that. But we see even further activity in the subsequent weeks that we're able to action as we're now on full furlough. And this is before we've even drawn down on any other potential facilities. So we're liquid to start with. We have further liquidity available, and our cash burn has been really controlled. 
One of the things we did do early on was bringing in a third-party consultant to really help us with a scenario planning of short-, mid- and long-term closures due to COVID and to manage our cash flow proposition by day, by week.

And we took those costs in '19, which Robyn outlined. So we're already under that way. But we'd already begun and continue to deepen our commitment to a real estate portfolio review. And I think four-wall profitability and location and needs really do change going forward, and we'll have ongoing data to look at that more deeply. So that's work in flight. We're not ready to share that yet. We're still doing an assessment, and the situation is very fluid.

Look, I mean, Michael, on the opening, no crystal ball here for Mark Tritton. But here's what I would say to you. We are -- we've moved from a now to a next to a future proposition in terms of our strategic planning. And while we are securing our current scenario and managing our teams, we are working on the reemergence and the reentry into the market and how that plays out. We don't have that time down, but we have multiple scenarios. We really tapped into major groups like [ Reeler ], who are doing a fantastic job in terms of sharing data and working with government to establish what reentry looks like. And to your point, Michael, I do think that it will be a region-by-region-based response. We'll be part of a bevy of retailers that follow the guidelines of government and come back into the market only when it's safe for our teams and our customers, and we're following those guidelines strictly. 
Now when that is, we factored in our financial models on multiple scenarios, including a very elongated period. We feel really comfortable in terms of our cash burn and our liquidity as a result without touching any further available funds. And so we've looked at the map, and we've looked at the time frame. The actual date we will be ready -- and as we've talked about, we've already accelerated a number of capabilities during this downtime like BOPIS, like curbside pickup and like store fulfill that we think are actually going to really sustain and benefit our total business, including the digital -- great digital growth we've been seeing through the fourth quarter and now into Q1.

I know you just said that, look, you obviously do have a lot of cash on the books, additional liquidity. You said you've taken through multiple scenarios where even on a long-dated basis, you're pretty comfortable. But could you give a little more detail in terms of what the time line is? And given the things that you've done like probably getting concessions on rents, furloughing 80% of the labor force, halting some CapEx, all those things, it's got to put you in at least a reasonable position to manage. So any more detail on that is important.

Look, I mean, that's why we're sharing a lot of these points. Liquidity is definitely there, and we took really early steps to control our costs and move forward. I mean to kind of lean into a little bit more, Curt, I would tell you that while we've been still working on the exit towards furlough and the negotiations, we're immediately able to cap off more than 40% of our weekly cash burn rate immediately. And we're implementing further plans through based on what Robyn and I shared. So we've got strong controls there. Our modeling, we, like everybody, and I mean we've been talking to our financial advisers as well as [ Reeler ] and the people I shared with, we've looked at an April scenario and a May scenario and an August scenario and an indefinite scenario. And in all of those, we've got really clear math about our sustainability and liquidity plus the availability to draw down on other facilities. So we've got controlled cash burn, we have cash, and we have a plan. 
Now this is not something that is years and years and years in the making. I think everyone is looking at this in these very short synapses but also looking at the worst-case scenarios. When we sat down with our Board and shared our worst-case scenarios, we have good liquidity, and we have stability in our business with the right actions taken to take us through. And I think we're in a really unusual position, Curt, in that we don't have rotting fruit in terms of our merchandise. We're primarily seasonless. We're not an apparel business, and we have sustainable product that we can leverage upon reentry, and we're not going to be in a blood bath in terms of cost. 
So there are some real benefits to this space. And there's no doubt that the home business has become very fruitful in this period. We just need the customers to be able to access us and other retailers and products in a more fluid way, which is an omnichannel environment of true digital and physical stores.

I think for us, it was tough to hit the COVID moment when we just saw some pivots happening in February. We knew we were plagued by issues in December and January, would be transparent around that. Some of it was self-inflicted. I mean when we don't have best sellers in stock, we've got discounting and we don't have our inventory. I mean some of the sales decline we saw in our stores wasn't necessarily traffic. We did some intel work on that, saw the customers were coming in, and they just couldn't find the product in stock. So we were shooting ourselves in the foot. That is easily rectifiable, and we started to do that straight at the end of January. We saw positive comps coming through or more positive comps in terms of churn rate in February. And as we stated, we saw an acceleration of our digital business. It was doing well during the period, but that accelerated even further. So we've been seeing our full year '19 business, we were about 19% penetration in digital in total. For the fourth quarter alone, that was up to 21.3%, and we had double-digit comps there. Now we've seen that digital business even more deeply accelerate with a lot of new customers, about 31%, 33% of our customers in this Q1 period being new to the Bed Bath & Beyond websites, buybuy BABY websites, et cetera. So we're garnering new business, and we're building plans with BOPIS, curbside and personalization to sustain those relationships. 
So we're excited, if that's a word I can even use in this moment, about what lies ahead. But it definitely was some gentle momentum coming our way that was positive in February that belied the December-January trends. And then we hit these goals at the moment.

What we've seen is these very sharp synapses. And one of the things that Robyn was outlining is the periods in which we were partially open then closed and then -- particularly in Bed Bath and then relying heavily on the digital business. We've seen strong conversion. It's never going to map out to be full coverage of our stores-based business. But we are seeing both demand and total sales in the 70%, 80% and 90% mark when we move into the April period. And as we mentioned, really ramping up and flexing with agility our capability to fulfill those orders, both in the stores that we're using as regional fulfillment centers as well as our DCs, have been tremendous. So we're meeting guest needs. We're working with them. We're fulfilling orders. We're working through our inventory, and we're building equity in our omni-always business.

I think our mix is very fluid at the moment. I'm -- clearly, people are leaning into cleaning, into kitchen, into baking, into home care. And so this is a great time for us. Our textile business is not as strong, and that's something that we see coming forward as people look to refresh their home. We think this is going to be -- if people have been staring at the same 4 walls for a month or 2 now, Simeon, I think the idea of refreshing your bathroom, your bedroom, your kitchen, that's going to be pivotal in terms of some of the engagement of customers and how they return into the market more than maybe an apparel purchase or definitely a travel purchase. 
So discretionary spending, I think, will be focused, and we may be a strong beneficiary there. So margin is balanced. And what we see is that our digital business always performs at a much lower coupon rate. And therefore, at this point, we're getting a really balanced response there. I think that the -- we see online acceleration. I think there are a lot of people who are talking around that. And I think the great thing about that is that -- some of the changes we've most recently made in terms of fulfillment and support. I mean not having BOPIS versus the rest of the industry has been an Achilles' heel. We were set to launch that in full in May in stores, and we've maintained that spend and commitment to be ready when our doors do open. And then have also added in curbside. And now we've stood up store fulfill, which was something that we had on our agenda, but we wanted to get through the other pieces first. We've accelerated those. And as you talked about that in terms of the impact, I'm no stranger with previous employers on the margin mix that a store fulfill via order or BOPIS can do in terms of the math and the margin on digital. So we'll start to model that out. 
Now is not the time to get accurate about that, but we believe that's positive things that lie ahead for us. And then we've already begun to convert some discretionary merchandise into more of an owned brand platform ahead of a major relaunch in 2021 at the start. So we'll see some margin benefits for those products in the back end, the digital fulfill benefits in the back end.

Look, I mean I think that we entered into promotional activity in a way that we hadn't ever before, Seth. I think that if we go back to the end of the third quarter, start of the fourth quarter, it was the first time we'd ever really been truly promotional out by the coupon. And we really didn't lay down the plans to get there in the right way. So we burnt the margin and we burnt a lot of inventory and weren't prepared to get back into stock. So they're kind of tough learnings. But they're also redeemable moments that we can translate into new actions. 
I think that the one thing that I've noticed coming into the business and have been working with the team on is the role of value and price/value equation. I think that we know that customers don't want to do the math, and they want to have simple, readable affordability. And I think that's what we're missing from our equation. Both in-store and online, we haven't been making value. And I don't mean just sharp price. I mean the resonating true value to the customer has been a little bit difficult in places than how we've operated. And so we've learned a ton of what not to do. And as a result, you're going to see coming through in our digital channel a refresh of how we're presenting value and talking to our guests with clarity and simplicity. You'll see that roll through circulars. And then when we open up, you'll start to see it manifest in things like end caps and price point presentation and real clear, understandable everyday value. So we -- there's no doubt that as we come out of this COVID-19 moment and with unemployment and some tough times ahead, customers want to be able to get value, see value, understand value and have it resonate with them quickly. And we think we've got some great plans in place to really step into that. And that doesn't mean giving away the margin farm, it just means being really clear on our intent upfront.

Look, I mean I think it's less about the stability and more about the long-term benefits. And really, we were just talking about postponing. We're not talking about canceling. The major one really there, Seth, is around the store remodel programs. I've been working on -- since I joined on a program with the team, we've got 3 test stores that are showing really positive signs of growth from the core model, and that was without any assortment changes. Just -- and any of the price point changes and clarity that we talked about. So refreshment of the stores is something we then fast tracked. And we're ready to roll out 25, 26 stores to really give us a model to accelerate our spend in subsequent years. Now that was going to take place and be ready on or before the beginning of the Back to College period so we didn't interrupt with our key selling period. And then in Q3, Q4, we would have been done. 
Having to ice those at the moment was really tough because we had some good work that we wanted to put into play. But it would have been crazy to spend that money, disrupt Q3 and Q4 and wanting to preserve some CapEx. So we've got the plans, we've got the info, and we've got the dream. We're just going to finesse that further as we get ready to implement that in early 2021. So it's postponed, not canceled.

Look, I mean, a couple of things there. I think that we've been -- Joe has been leading the charge here and having deep conversation with all our majors and our general vendor bases about flow. If you go back to the inventory position that we had, there's kind of 2 things going there. The good news was that overall, we reduced our inventory by about 16% at the close of the quarter. And so we were working leaner on that. But inside of that, we did have big misses not by having more inventory, we think that's a good level that we can come down to, but we could have traded some of our mix to be more in stock about key items and generated more sales and gross margin by having the right merchandise. So again, the level coming down is a positive. The curation within the level becomes critical. Joe has really lend into that charge, getting it back in stock about top 100, 250, 500 items and making sure that we can draw that down. I think also getting the flexibility to draw the stock from different places helps us to kind of speed up sales and get clarity and delivery to the customer on time. 
In terms of the point around the commitments, we quickly moved into an evaluation of high-risk merchandise, seasonal merchandise and anything that kind of -- if we looked at our long-term plan of what could have been a close at hold, really looking at minimizing our quantification of risk and adjusting flow. So that's a very fluid discussion, a very real discussion. And that began on day 1 when we started to see the problem emerge. So it's a real strength in having Joe on board, focusing on this. And our overall inventory plans are really highlighted by being in stock of best sellers, getting our preplan with our vendors in place so that we could get that in stock and we play out the third and fourth quarter in a different way and then keeping a close eye on seasonality and flow of merchandise from offshore vendors.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I'm not going to contribute to the dialogue other than to say we have multiple scenarios, and some of them quite deep, to ensure that we've got our liquidity in place even if the return is there. 
Our general -- I think there's going to be different rules here. I think you've got to remember that -- I think that this is -- we're looking at a lot of the recessionary moments from the past as models. But you also have the fear factor of safety inside piece. So large gatherings, shopping at the mall, those things become more questionable maybe for others. So less than 10% of our fleet is mall-based. We're big box, and we're independent. We think that will work in our favor, and that helps us to do things like curbside pickup and the fluidity of BOPIS much faster than maybe a mall-based retailer. And we think there'll be a gradual turn on, but we also think there will be categories that come back faster. And I think that home will be a beneficiary much faster than apparel. And we think that there's some positive upside to establishing relationships and transactions with customers early, but we know it's going to be graded. And a lot of that, as you mentioned and I mentioned earlier, will be a phased approach based on safety and regional return to full business.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Look, I mean we've already identified and are moving forward on those strategies. So that remains unchanged with this moment, and I want to be really clear around that. A couple of things there, Brad. I think the first thing that we noticed, and we just talked about value earlier on the call, is that we have some real gaps in opening price point and the clarity of communication around value to our customers. So we're leaning into that space. I think the second piece is around really reducing a high level of duplication in items. And we really want to focus on a curation of differentiation and relevance to our customer. And where we've done that, we've seen real wins. In some of these stores that I was talking about earlier that I was playing with the models on, we've reduced the SKU count by 20% to 30%, and we were seeing double-digit comps at the same time. So when we curate, we make our assortment more focused and understandable. 
And then I've just been working even today on -- with Joe on a number of really great owned brands that we're cultivating and getting ready to launch at the start of next fiscal year because these things take time, and we're developing newness there, which will help reframe out each of the key rooms and categories and occasions that we are currently dominant in and have strong market share but also ones where we want to cultivate. So I think that there's a modernity and a freshness and a relevance and an affordability in that home and personal care space as well as our efforts inside BABY, which were well underway. That can really create more relevant merchandise assortment. So we're upturning a lot of rocks there. We're renegotiating costs across the board, which had already been done and worked on. 
So there's a margin upside, there's a mix upside, and then there's a perception upside, including value, that we see coming. And that will be evolutionary throughout the rest of 2020, and you're really going to see some strong green shoots in late 2020, early 2021.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It's a great question. I mean, look, I mean I think we really would have been hitting on some high double-digit comps. And I think that we had to restrain some demand based on availability of inventory, especially in key items. And so those items are strong. They're not markdown-driven. That would have been a real boom for us, Seth. And I think that bodes well for where we can cut and paste those experiences into benefits in third and fourth quarter in 2020. 
The upside of it, I think, is also going to be distorted by the current behavior in COVID-19. And that's why I'm really excited about the fact that we've built background capabilities very quickly to sustain that as the total market opens back up. And then we've been seeing where we have really changed the cadence of our communication dialogue and the way we've set up our digital website to be more relevant to weekly guest needs. We're really connecting with customers and driving high double-digit comps in those categories that we're leading into and building real engagement and data with these customers. So I think it's too early to say how high is high. I think the industry in total believes that penetration rates will be increased. We're already on that pathway. And when I'm saying 21% of our business in Q4 was already digital, we see a lot of upside in that, but we also want to balance out that with growth in our stores.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I mean bread makers, blenders and vacuums and cleaning products, water filtration, coffee, coffee, coffee, like -- people are like, hell, we're just going to make the best of it at home. Now that's a boom for us. And we think -- we actually think that as people come out at this moment, we think that some of the data that we're seeing very early, and it's preliminary, there's going to be some discretionary spend move away from specific categories. 
But we believe that people will want to celebrate their home, reinforce it, refresh it, invite friends for smaller moments and build equity in entertaining and start to celebrate the home. And then leading into a Back to College moment, which we're really primed, which is your home away from home, we're really ready to take on that. So I think this kind of new cocooning, new nesting, new love for home and valuing the environment, while we all want to step outside, clearly, I think there's going to be safety as a consideration. And I think there's going to be a love and respect for the home that we're ready to take advantage of.

I think that was one of the first things that Joe and team and Robyn really worked on, was like, hey, great partners, this is going to be tough when we all know we're in a situation we know we're going to be in for the long term. We know we're liquid, we know we're strong, and we have a plan, and just let everybody work together on what we can do here. And so without going into great detail, know that those conversations were very robust, and we've asked for a level of support. It's just short to midterm. It's not the standard way we'll operate. And we'll all work on it together. And we've seen some really good lean-ins there to change that liquidity. And as I said, some of the burn rates we talked about earlier were not inclusive of those actions taking hold yet. So that's a further benefit to cash flow. 
But yes, look, it was on our to-do list very early on, and we began in earnest to sit with our partners and renegotiate just in the short to mid how we can play with terms and how we can work.

As Janet said, we are coming together tonight from remote locations, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us under these unprecedented circumstances. 
Frankly, it seems like a different place and time. Life as we knew it before March is a distant memory. We are in the moment now, and I'd like to start by discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll talk about the strategic actions we are taking in this moment to build momentum around our transformation plans. Then Robyn will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide some further context around the potential impacts from the pandemic. 
Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers and our teams. We are providing essential infant, health and personal care items to local communities through our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores as well as serving the rest of our loyal customers online through our digital channels. Our teams are working around the clock to provide these essential products to our customers and to ensure the supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible. I would like to take a minute to personally thank our associate teams on behalf of management and the Board. We thank you for your above-and-beyond service, attitude and dedication to our company and our loyal customers despite this extremely challenging situation. Making it easy to feel at home means different things to different people, and our teams have been working incredibly hard to support our customers. I also want to say thank you to our loyal customers and assure you that we will continue to work hard to help you access the essential products we sell as you manage through these very difficult times. 
In this moment, we are focused on facilitating and coordinating our ongoing response to the current pandemic. There is no historical playbook for this situation, but we have a remarkable team, robust contingency plans and a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to navigate this unprecedented challenge with confidence. We quickly initiated our contingency plan, creating an essential response unit with emergency task force groups to focus on several priority areas, including our people, operations, customers, technology and our finances. While this situation is like nothing we've seen before, we are adapting as necessary and taking decisive actions to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers and strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. This is an important time for us now and moving forward. Bed Bath & Beyond can play an important role in supporting customers and their families in making it easy to feel at home. 
All but approximately 170 of our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores are now temporarily closed at least until May 2. We continue to provide essential products such as infant, health and personal care items in store, subject to state and local regulations, and online through our various digital channels. We are rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. They are relying on us more than ever to deliver essential products directly to their home. 
All 4 of our e-commerce fulfillment centers are currently operating. And by the end of this week, we will have converted approximately 25% of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers to use our vast inventory resources to assign orders locally and deliver quickly. 
With these conversions, we expanded our fulfillment capacity significantly. The regional fulfillment stores have doubled the capacity of our entire fulfillment network, facilitating approximately 44% of our overall daily orders with almost 40% of these orders being fulfilled within 50 miles of the customers' home. This has been an incredible learning curve for us, and we continue to optimize our regional fulfillment capabilities to deliver faster and at lower cost. 
While our supply chain is moving quickly to support our digital business in real time, rerouting products from the chain to DCs and regional fulfillment stores, our technology team has stood up a 24-hour group to continuously refine the order allocation logic between the fulfillment stores and DCs. Our buying team is rerouting store on orders to the regional fulfillment locations and DCs while at the same time canceling purchase orders and modifying receipt forecasts to reduce store inventory levels. 
On the consumer-facing side, our teams are closely monitoring top sellers and adjusting quickly to get products that our customers need and partnering with our vendors to help keep us in stock and well positioned. I want to thank all of our business partners for their efforts and collaboration during this time. 
This kind of strategic action and innovation has allowed us to quickly implement curbside pickup, which was launched April 1 at buybuy BABY. In the first full week alone, we completed more than 11,000 curbside orders. We're also introducing curbside pickup at our Harmon stores later this week. Also this week, we are rolling our Buy Online Pick Up In Store at our BABY stores. We are quickly learning how our customers want to shop with us, and we will continue to evolve the process digitally to create a best-in-class experience. Both BOPIS and curbside pickup will be rolled out to our Bed Bath & Beyond stores as a new service offering for our customers where we can safely reopen. These new services were fast tracked during this period and will significantly enhance our fulfillment capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. 
With the vast majority of our stores temporarily closed, our customer-facing digital channels continue to service our customers, and we are seeing online demand grow significantly. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond digital business is seeing net sales growth of more than 90% for the month of April to date, further strengthening our omnichannel strategic direction. This demand is being facilitated by our agile digital and marketing teams who are working together, responding to consumer data, creating newness and freshness across our sites, highlighting items customers need to make it easy to feel at home and communicating important information about changes in store hours and closures as well as safety measures so that our customers are clear on how we are operating and how they can shop with us. 
As the quarantine phase of this pandemic has taken hold, we are seeing consumer purchasing demand focus on categories such as water filtration, air purifiers, vaporizers and humidifiers as well as kitchen electrics, cleaning and coffee needs. Now over the past month, we sold the equivalent of 10 million cups of coffee and 400% loaf bread makers over the last year. And last week, we sold over 100% more vacuums compared to the same period of time last year. 
This action to temporary close our stores has, of course, fundamentally changed the nature of our business in the short to midterm. The impact on our stores is obvious, but this decision affects the entire company. From IT to merchandising, finance to HR, the shape and structure of our business is radically different in this new environment across concepts and across the country. 
So in this moment, we are taking a holistic approach to managing our financial position, including larger efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen our liquidity. In conjunction with the recent decision to extend the temporary store closures, we implemented several additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of our store associates and a percentage of our corporate associates until at least May 2. Salaries will also reduce for myself and the executive team as well as the Board. We put an immediate stop to $150 million in CapEx spend and put a hold on share repurchases and future dividends. Robyn will provide further detail on our proactive measures in a minute. 
We are balancing our ability to provide jobs and financial support for our associates in the short, medium and long term as well as prioritizing investments designed to strengthen our business. We believe these actions will help us further weather the storm and preserve our financial health for the good of our associates, customers and shareholders. 
If there is a silver lining, I would say that given the monumental changes we've made to our business over the past 4 weeks, our ability to act decisively, partner up and move with speed and agility has been greatly enhanced. I'm very proud of the ideas, inspiration and commitment that all our associates have made to serve our customers and our business. It's been incredible to come together as one united virtual team across the company to work together in ways perhaps that would have not been possible or even thought of in the past. We are leveraging this learning opportunity to be more collaborative and flexible in our focused priorities and then move more quickly so that we are ready to welcome our customers back when we can safely reopen our stores.
We have also provided much-needed support for local communities, serving food and care packages to seniors, military personnel and their families plus children in need from our Christmas Tree Shops stores across the country. And we've donated more than 0.5 million Easter chocolates, candies, cookies, baskets and toys to dozens of local charities, shelters, schools and community organizations nationwide from over 250 of our Cost Plus World Market stores. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, which just seem like a lifetime ago. In short, the pressures of store traffic trends and heavy promotional activity, coupled with the inventory management issues around the holiday selling period, hampered our efforts to stabilize the business in the fourth quarter. These trends are consistent with the information we provided on February 11 when we issued preliminary financial data for the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. 
Product availability with certain key promotional categories, such as kitchen electrics, leading into the holiday period were either too low or just out of stock. We just didn't have enough of the right stuff, which hurt us. We are confident this is fully rectifiable in terms of our learning plan and implementation from now until the back half of fiscal 2020. 
Our fourth quarter results were also pressured by heavier clearance activity during the quarter as we rapidly actioned on our strategic inventory reduction program. Now we surpassed the halfway mark of this initiative and are pleased with our progress. It's important to note that prior to this current business environment, we were sharpening our focus on inventory, ending the fourth quarter with approximately 16% less retail inventory at cost on an adjusted basis versus a year ago so operating leaner and on a lower SKU base. We are now focusing our attention on optimizing our merchandising mix, which of course is a key focus for our new Chief Merchant, Joe Hartsig. 
For the full fourth quarter, we also reported a positive shift in sales across our digital channel with a return to strong growth of about 16%. Sales in our mobile channels for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY each grew more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and orders taken through our mobile app were up over 75%. These quarterly results strengthened our resolve to continue to make necessary bold and broad-based changes needed to modernize our business and gives us confidence about our ability to improve upon this quarterly performance. This includes the strategic restructuring program we implemented in late February to reduce annual SG&A expense by approximately $85 million and reset our cost structure. 
Prior to COVID-19, we had solid strategic plans for fiscal 2020. In this moment, we need to be agile and focused on simplifying and strengthening our business where it matters most to our customers and reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Let me now address the issues at hand and what we are working on. First, recruiting talent remains a top priority. We have an extensive interview process underway for the open roles. We have made bold moves. We have a robust process and have identified key candidates, with Joe Hartsig being the first major appointment as our new Chief Merchandising Officer. There will be more news on other great talent to come in the coming weeks. I'm excited to welcome Joe to the team. He has more than 30 years of experience in consumer brand development and retail merchandising with well-known consumer businesses like Walgreens, Walmart, Motorola and SC Johnson. To me, Joe is a merchant's merchant. And I'm looking to him to be a leader and a teacher as we rebuild our business, including improving key items in stocks and improving curation and further differentiation of our assortment, which is our #1 priority. 
Second, we remain focused on generating funds from the sale of assets and simplifying our business. In addition to the previously announced sale-leaseback transaction, we recently sold the One Kings Lane business to a third party for an undisclosed amount. As previously disclosed, we ended into a definitive agreement to sell our PersonalizationMall.com business to 1-800-FLOWERS for $252 million. 1-800 was required to close the transaction on March 30 but breached its obligation to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require them to close and intend to vigorously enforce our rights. While we can make no assurances, we will continue to pursue other portfolio adjustments and evaluate the remaining owned real estate in an effort to create a stronger and more focused portfolio. 
Lastly and most importantly, we are driving our strategic growth plans. Under the current business environment, we have modified our capital investments, but we'll continue to invest with confidence where it matters most. We now plan to invest about $250 million focusing on our core business and key projects that support the omnichannel future of our company in 2020 and beyond, which are more relevant than ever, such as our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including BOPIS and curbside pickup, omni inventory management as well as digital marketing and personalization. 
At a high level, we are reengineering our supply chain and our vendor relationships as well as further strengthening our owned-brand strategy. We are postponing store remodels due to the coronavirus situation and the timing issues it's created as we don't want to interfere with the critical third and fourth quarter holiday period in 2020. We will also continue to review our store footprint as we have nearly 250 leases that are up for renewal in 2020 alone, which gives us added financial flexibility. In technology, we'll continue to invest in order allocation logic to better leverage our stores and fulfillment centers and improve our site speed and checkout experience in addition to simplifying the process. 
Now we have postponed our plans for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction to preserve our financial position and retain financial flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to longer term, and we will reevaluate when appropriate. Now is the time to stay liquid until we have more clarity on the global situations surrounding COVID-19. All the steps we've taken since I arrived at the company 5 short months ago, including this COVID-19 moment, reinforce our preliminary strategic plan focused on a singular purpose, to make it easy to feel at home. 
Our strategy will deliver against 5 key pillars, namely product, price, promise, place and people. We believe this strategy is more relevant today than ever and will support significant improvement in our financial performance and a deeper connection with our loyal customers. In this time, when home is even more central to our lives and being safe at home with family is essential, Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home. We will provide inspiration and a curated, affordable assortment so that our customers can create a home they love. 
Now before turning the call over to Robyn, I just wanted to mention that we have previously planned to host an investor event this spring. And now under these circumstances, we are exploring other options, including potentially a virtual event, to take place at a more suitable time. We'll want to introduce you to the new team, showcase some of our new capabilities and early results and lay out our longer-term strategic growth objectives for the business. We'll keep you updated on our plans. 
While we deal with the immediate priorities, we continue our work to drive the company forward. We have robust contingency plans, and I am confident that we are able to navigate this crisis. We have an iconic brand with great consumer brand loyalty, and we're taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with our customers as we strengthen our omni-always approach. I believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
Robyn will now review our fourth quarter results and then provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures we have taken to date to protect our financial position and maintain flexibility. I will then come back for some closing remarks.

I hope you are all faring well under these very unusual circumstances. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.92 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter includes an unfavorable impact of $0.91 per diluted share for special items, including $41 million in severance costs related to the strategic restructuring program initiated in February 2020 and the extensive leadership changes announced in December 2019; a noncash charge of approximately $35 million for the impairment of certain store level assets; a noncash charge of approximately $33 million for the impairment of certain trade names and other assets; and an expense of $33 million related to the loss on the sale-leaseback transaction announced in January 2020. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.38. 
The remainder of my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, as applicable, consistent with our prior disclosures to better represent year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative period. From this year's fourth quarter, we exclude the items I just mentioned, along with the related impact on the provision for income taxes. And from last year's fourth quarter, we exclude the $510 million pretax goodwill impairment charge and the related impact on the provision for income taxes. As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending February 29 and included the Cyber Monday holiday week, while our fourth quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending March 2 and did not include the Cyber Monday holiday week. 
On February 11, we reported preliminary unaudited financial performance data for the first 2 months of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We shared this update to provide visibility into the then current pressures on our business, including store traffic declines, combined with inventory management issues and the impact on revenue and margin resulting from increased promotional activity and markdowns. 
Net sales in the quarter were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 6.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 5.6%, reflecting a high single-digit decline in the number of transactions partially offset by a low single-digit increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined about 10%, while comp sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 16%. Similar to last quarter, our sales in the fourth quarter were positively modified by the calendar shift of the Cyber Monday holiday week. Adjusting for this calendar shift to exclude the Cyber Monday holiday week in both periods, our comp sales for the quarter declined 11%, with a decline in store sales of 13.6% and growth in digital sales of 1.1%. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% of net sales as compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 210 basis point decline was primarily due to an unfavorable impact on merchandise margins from promotional activity and markdowns. In addition, we had an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense due to the higher penetration of digital sales within the total mix of quarterly sales. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was 30.7% of net sales as compared to 28.2% of net sales in the prior year period. This 250 basis point increase in SG&A, in order of magnitude, was primarily due to about 100 basis points of consulting expense associated with our efforts to expedite the ongoing transformation initiatives and review of assets and an increase in advertising expense, including digital marketing, related to the heavy promotional activity in the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effect of fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation on a lower sales base. 
Our quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.3% on an adjusted basis and included $8.3 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. As a result of the lower pretax earnings base in the fourth quarter, these net after-tax benefits have a greater impact on the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year on an adjusted basis was 19.7% and included approximately $8.9 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring in that quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong cash position with about $1.4 billion in cash and investments, including over $250 million in net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed during the quarter. Adjusted retail inventories of $2.1 billion at cost, excluding a charge for markdowns associated with our inventory reduction initiative, reflected a significant reduction of about 16% or over $400 million at cost at the end of the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period. We continue to action against our previously communicated $1 billion inventory reduction program at retail, and we are now about halfway through the program and plan to continue to work down the remaining inventory in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the year were $277 million, with nearly 50% of the expense related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx expense was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings. We closed 26 stores and opened 2 stores during the quarter. 
Regarding share repurchase activity, there were no open market repurchases during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have suspended repurchasing of our shares while conducting the review of our retail portfolio and real estate assets. The company currently remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to long term and will reevaluate when appropriate. To clarify, our previously announced first quarter dividend was paid on April 14 and was not impacted by the temporary suspension. 
Moving on to fiscal 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will, of course, be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. We're monitoring the situation closely regarding our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. 
We ended fiscal 2019 with cash and investments of $1.4 billion. And while we feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we plan to take or are taking proactive steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, such as drawing down the additional $236 million of available funds remaining from our revolving credit facility; suspended our plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction; postponed $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020, including some store remodels; furloughed the majority of our workforce, including store and corporate associates, until at least May 2; temporarily reduce the salaries of our executive team, including myself and Mark, by 30%; temporarily reduced the quarterly cash compensation of our independent Board of Directors by 30%; reducing discretionary spend, such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with maintenance of stores that are temporarily closed; renegotiating extensions of payment terms for goods and services and rents; managing to lower inventory levels; and implementing applicable benefits of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. 
Considering these circumstances, while we have trimmed CapEx by $150 million, we are now prioritizing approximately $250 million in essential capital expenditures to drive our strategic growth plans, as Mark described a few minutes ago. In addition, our capital structure provides further flexibility, including the potential to utilize significant balance sheet assets to generate incremental liquidity if needed. As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we had approximately $2 billion of quality, primarily nonseasonal inventory on our balance sheet, which has not been pledged as collateral under our existing debt arrangements. These actions, together with our strategic efforts to reset the organization's cost structure including the recent restructuring program and our strong balance sheet, put us in a better position to manage through this period of uncertainty. We remain committed to keeping our shareholders informed about the business and our strategy to reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Now I would like to provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the full impact of this situation won't be known for months. However, what's important right now is that we are proactively managing the immediate challenges and playing an important role for our customers. As of Friday, March 20, we had temporarily closed over 50% of our stores across all banners until April 3. The approximately 700 stores that remained open in operation were stores that sell essential items such as health care, personal care, infant care, cleaning supplies or food and beverages. The following week, the company announced that it was temporarily closing all retail banners across the U.S. and Canada other than buybuy BABY and Harmon stores, subject to state and local regulations. This left about 170 of our 1,500 stores in operation to provide the essential items we sell to customers. On April 2, we extended the temporary store closures until May 2. 
For the month of March, while we have not yet finalized our monthly results, we do have visibility to our sales performance. For the March period, we are able to share preliminary unaudited financial performance data. Overall, net sales across all banners were down approximately 31% versus the prior year March period. This was led by a decline of about 41% in store sales, as expected, due to less customer in-store shopping, resulting from self-quarantine guidelines and the initiation of temporary store closures and limited store hours. Net sales from our digital channels, however, were strong in March, up about 16%, benefiting from an increase in digital shopping due to COVID-19 and further enhancements we have made in our fulfillment capabilities, including converting about 25% of our temporary closed stores to regional fulfillment stores, as Mark spoke about earlier. The sales performance for both buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores, which remain open to provide essential items, was better than the overall company for the March period. 
Through the first 2 weeks of April, the fiscal quarter-to-date overall decline in our total net sales is around 42% primarily due to the additional temporary store closures. However, net sales from our digital channels have further strengthened with year-over-year growth of more than 35%. Due to the level of market uncertainty, we will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time. 
As we work through 2020, we believe our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. Our strong cash position, along with our near-term actions, provide the company with continued financial resilience and ample short and midterm liquidity to fund the operations of the business. To reiterate what Mark said earlier, we do believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet.

As Robyn shared, we have tremendous opportunities to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. We'll be driving meaningful and inspiring engagements with our customers, refining and amplifying an exciting omnichannel assortment, providing compelling value through price and differentiation and delivering an omni-always shopping experience that serves our customers' needs. And we will continually look for ways to optimize our business model, whether through the supply chain or through other operating efficiencies across the business. We'll also take advantage of the market dislocation that has already occurred and that will likely to continue, resulting in changes in the competitive landscape and opportunities for us to grow market share in the home, baby and personal care spaces. This time has been a test for all retailers. We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is positioned to come out stronger as we have the cash, the talent, the right plans and great, loyal customers.

I think, Bobby, this is a really fluid moment, and we are really pleased with the work we've done to date.

And we took those costs in '19, which Robyn outlined. So we're already under that way. But we'd already begun and continue to deepen our commitment to a real estate portfolio review. And I think four-wall profitability and location and needs really do change going forward, and we'll have ongoing data to look at that more deeply. So that's work in flight. We're not ready to share that yet. We're still doing an assessment, and the situation is very fluid.

Look, I mean, Michael, on the opening, no crystal ball here for Mark Tritton. But here's what I would say to you. We are -- we've moved from a now to a next to a future proposition in terms of our strategic planning. And while we are securing our current scenario and managing our teams, we are working on the reemergence and the reentry into the market and how that plays out. We don't have that time down, but we have multiple scenarios. We really tapped into major groups like [ Reeler ], who are doing a fantastic job in terms of sharing data and working with government to establish what reentry looks like. And to your point, Michael, I do think that it will be a region-by-region-based response. We'll be part of a bevy of retailers that follow the guidelines of government and come back into the market only when it's safe for our teams and our customers, and we're following those guidelines strictly. 
Now when that is, we factored in our financial models on multiple scenarios, including a very elongated period. We feel really comfortable in terms of our cash burn and our liquidity as a result without touching any further available funds. And so we've looked at the map, and we've looked at the time frame. The actual date we will be ready -- and as we've talked about, we've already accelerated a number of capabilities during this downtime like BOPIS, like curbside pickup and like store fulfill that we think are actually going to really sustain and benefit our total business, including the digital -- great digital growth we've been seeing through the fourth quarter and now into Q1.

I know you just said that, look, you obviously do have a lot of cash on the books, additional liquidity. You said you've taken through multiple scenarios where even on a long-dated basis, you're pretty comfortable. But could you give a little more detail in terms of what the time line is? And given the things that you've done like probably getting concessions on rents, furloughing 80% of the labor force, halting some CapEx, all those things, it's got to put you in at least a reasonable position to manage. So any more detail on that is important.

Look, I mean, that's why we're sharing a lot of these points. Liquidity is definitely there, and we took really early steps to control our costs and move forward. I mean to kind of lean into a little bit more, Curt, I would tell you that while we've been still working on the exit towards furlough and the negotiations, we're immediately able to cap off more than 40% of our weekly cash burn rate immediately. And we're implementing further plans through based on what Robyn and I shared. So we've got strong controls there. Our modeling, we, like everybody, and I mean we've been talking to our financial advisers as well as [ Reeler ] and the people I shared with, we've looked at an April scenario and a May scenario and an August scenario and an indefinite scenario. And in all of those, we've got really clear math about our sustainability and liquidity plus the availability to draw down on other facilities. So we've got controlled cash burn, we have cash, and we have a plan. 
Now this is not something that is years and years and years in the making. I think everyone is looking at this in these very short synapses but also looking at the worst-case scenarios. When we sat down with our Board and shared our worst-case scenarios, we have good liquidity, and we have stability in our business with the right actions taken to take us through. And I think we're in a really unusual position, Curt, in that we don't have rotting fruit in terms of our merchandise. We're primarily seasonless. We're not an apparel business, and we have sustainable product that we can leverage upon reentry, and we're not going to be in a blood bath in terms of cost. 
So there are some real benefits to this space. And there's no doubt that the home business has become very fruitful in this period. We just need the customers to be able to access us and other retailers and products in a more fluid way, which is an omnichannel environment of true digital and physical stores.

I think for us, it was tough to hit the COVID moment when we just saw some pivots happening in February. We knew we were plagued by issues in December and January, would be transparent around that. Some of it was self-inflicted. I mean when we don't have best sellers in stock, we've got discounting and we don't have our inventory. I mean some of the sales decline we saw in our stores wasn't necessarily traffic. We did some intel work on that, saw the customers were coming in, and they just couldn't find the product in stock. So we were shooting ourselves in the foot. That is easily rectifiable, and we started to do that straight at the end of January. 
We saw positive comps coming through or more positive comps in terms of churn rate in February. And as we stated, we saw an acceleration of our digital business. It was doing well during the period, but that accelerated even further. So we've been seeing our full year '19 business, we were about 19% penetration in digital in total. For the fourth quarter alone, that was up to 21.3%, and we had double-digit comps there. Now we've seen that digital business even more deeply accelerate with a lot of new customers, about 31%, 33% of our customers in this Q1 period being new to the Bed Bath & Beyond websites, buybuy BABY websites, et cetera. So we're garnering new business, and we're building plans with BOPIS, curbside and personalization to sustain those relationships. 
So we're excited, if that's a word I can even use in this moment, about what lies ahead. But it definitely was some gentle momentum coming our way that was positive in February that belied the December-January trends. And then we hit these goals at the moment.

I think our mix is very fluid at the moment. I'm -- clearly, people are leaning into cleaning, into kitchen, into baking, into home care. And so this is a great time for us. Our textile business is not as strong, and that's something that we see coming forward as people look to refresh their home. We think this is going to be -- if people have been staring at the same 4 walls for a month or 2 now, Simeon, I think the idea of refreshing your bathroom, your bedroom, your kitchen, that's going to be pivotal in terms of some of the engagement of customers and how they return into the market more than maybe an apparel purchase or definitely a travel purchase. 
So discretionary spending, I think, will be focused, and we may be a strong beneficiary there. So margin is balanced. And what we see is that our digital business always performs at a much lower coupon rate. And therefore, at this point, we're getting a really balanced response there. I think that the -- we see online acceleration. I think there are a lot of people who are talking around that. And I think the great thing about that is that -- some of the changes we've most recently made in terms of fulfillment and support. I mean not having BOPIS versus the rest of the industry has been an Achilles' heel. We were set to launch that in full in May in stores, and we've maintained that spend and commitment to be ready when our doors do open. And then have also added in curbside. And now we've stood up store fulfill, which was something that we had on our agenda, but we wanted to get through the other pieces first. We've accelerated those. And as you talked about that in terms of the impact, I'm no stranger with previous employers on the margin mix that a store fulfill via order or BOPIS can do in terms of the math and the margin on digital. So we'll start to model that out. 
Now is not the time to get accurate about that, but we believe that's positive things that lie ahead for us. And then we've already begun to convert some discretionary merchandise into more of an owned brand platform ahead of a major relaunch in 2021 at the start. So we'll see some margin benefits for those products in the back end, the digital fulfill benefits in the back end. But it will be a new journey.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

Look, I mean I think that we entered into promotional activity in a way that we hadn't ever before, Seth. I think that if we go back to the end of the third quarter, start of the fourth quarter, it was the first time we'd ever really been truly promotional out by the coupon. And we really didn't lay down the plans to get there in the right way. So we burnt the margin and we burnt a lot of inventory and weren't prepared to get back into stock. So they're kind of tough learnings. But they're also redeemable moments that we can translate into new actions. 
I think that the one thing that I've noticed coming into the business and have been working with the team on is the role of value and price/value equation. I think that we know that customers don't want to do the math, and they want to have simple, readable affordability. And I think that's what we're missing from our equation. Both in-store and online, we haven't been making value. And I don't mean just sharp price. I mean the resonating true value to the customer has been a little bit difficult in places than how we've operated. And so we've learned a ton of what not to do. And as a result, you're going to see coming through in our digital channel a refresh of how we're presenting value and talking to our guests with clarity and simplicity. You'll see that roll through circulars. And then when we open up, you'll start to see it manifest in things like end caps and price point presentation and real clear, understandable everyday value. 
So we -- there's no doubt that as we come out of this COVID-19 moment and with unemployment and some tough times ahead, customers want to be able to get value, see value, understand value and have it resonate with them quickly. And we think we've got some great plans in place to really step into that. And that doesn't mean giving away the margin farm, it just means being really clear on our intent upfront.

Look, I mean I think it's less about the stability and more about the long-term benefits. And really, we were just talking about postponing. We're not talking about canceling. The major one really there, Seth, is around the store remodel programs. I've been working on -- since I joined on a program with the team, we've got 3 test stores that are showing really positive signs of growth from the core model, and that was without any assortment changes. Just -- and any of the price point changes and clarity that we talked about. So refreshment of the stores is something we then fast tracked. And we're ready to roll out 25, 26 stores to really give us a model to accelerate our spend in subsequent years. Now that was going to take place and be ready on or before the beginning of the Back to College period so we didn't interrupt with our key selling period. And then in Q3, Q4, we would have been done. 
Having to ice those at the moment was really tough because we had some good work that we wanted to put into play. But it would have been crazy to spend that money, disrupt Q3 and Q4 and wanting to preserve some CapEx. So we've got the plans, we've got the info, and we've got the dream. We're just going to finesse that further as we get ready to implement that in early 2021. So it's postponed, not canceled.

Look, I mean, a couple of things there. I think that we've been -- Joe has been leading the charge here and having deep conversation with all our majors and our general vendor bases about flow. If you go back to the inventory position that we had, there's kind of 2 things going there. The good news was that overall, we reduced our inventory by about 16% at the close of the quarter. And so we were working leaner on that. But inside of that, we did have big misses not by having more inventory, we think that's a good level that we can come down to, but we could have traded some of our mix to be more in stock about key items and generated more sales and gross margin by having the right merchandise. So again, the level coming down is a positive. The curation within the level becomes critical. Joe has really lend into that charge, getting it back in stock about top 100, 250, 500 items and making sure that we can draw that down. I think also getting the flexibility to draw the stock from different places helps us to kind of speed up sales and get clarity and delivery to the customer on time. 
In terms of the point around the commitments, we quickly moved into an evaluation of high-risk merchandise, seasonal merchandise and anything that kind of -- if we looked at our long-term plan of what could have been a close at hold, really looking at minimizing our quantification of risk and adjusting flow. So that's a very fluid discussion, a very real discussion. And that began on day 1 when we started to see the problem emerge. So it's a real strength in having Joe on board, focusing on this. And our overall inventory plans are really highlighted by being in stock of best sellers, getting our preplan with our vendors in place so that we could get that in stock and we play out the third and fourth quarter in a different way and then keeping a close eye on seasonality and flow of merchandise from offshore vendors.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I think in general, in the industry, the consensus that I've been seeing, Jonathan, is that everyone is planning for -- I mean this is not going to be a light switch moment where everything goes back to the immediate moment. We have got -- our financial plans are very conservative when I talked about the modeling in terms of an expectation of a highly reduced sales level so that we can work out our financial plan to be as liquid as possible no matter what. And so there's a number of percentages being bandied around there. I'm not going to contribute to the dialogue other than to say we have multiple scenarios, and some of them quite deep, to ensure that we've got our liquidity in place even if the return is there. 
Our general -- I think there's going to be different rules here. I think you've got to remember that -- I think that this is -- we're looking at a lot of the recessionary moments from the past as models. But you also have the fear factor of safety inside piece. So large gatherings, shopping at the mall, those things become more questionable maybe for others. So less than 10% of our fleet is mall-based. We're big box, and we're independent. We think that will work in our favor, and that helps us to do things like curbside pickup and the fluidity of BOPIS much faster than maybe a mall-based retailer. And we think there'll be a gradual turn on, but we also think there will be categories that come back faster. And I think that home will be a beneficiary much faster than apparel.

Look, I mean we've already identified and are moving forward on those strategies. So that remains unchanged with this moment, and I want to be really clear around that. A couple of things there, Brad. I think the first thing that we noticed, and we just talked about value earlier on the call, is that we have some real gaps in opening price point and the clarity of communication around value to our customers. So we're leaning into that space. I think the second piece is around really reducing a high level of duplication in items. And we really want to focus on a curation of differentiation and relevance to our customer. And where we've done that, we've seen real wins. In some of these stores that I was talking about earlier that I was playing with the models on, we've reduced the SKU count by 20% to 30%, and we were seeing double-digit comps at the same time. So when we curate, we make our assortment more focused and understandable. 
And then I've just been working even today on -- with Joe on a number of really great owned brands that we're cultivating and getting ready to launch at the start of next fiscal year because these things take time, and we're developing newness there, which will help reframe out each of the key rooms and categories and occasions that we are currently dominant in and have strong market share but also ones where we want to cultivate. So I think that there's a modernity and a freshness and a relevance and an affordability in that home and personal care space as well as our efforts inside BABY, which were well underway. That can really create more relevant merchandise assortment. So we're upturning a lot of rocks there. We're renegotiating costs across the board, which had already been done and worked on. 
So there's a margin upside, there's a mix upside, and then there's a perception upside, including value, that we see coming. And that will be evolutionary throughout the rest of 2020, and you're really going to see some strong green shoots in late 2020, early 2021.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

And I think that we had to restrain some demand based on availability of inventory, especially in key items. And so those items are strong. They're not markdown-driven. That would have been a real boom for us, Seth. And I think that bodes well for where we can cut and paste those experiences into benefits in third and fourth quarter in 2020. 
The upside of it, I think, is also going to be distorted by the current behavior in COVID-19. And that's why I'm really excited about the fact that we've built background capabilities very quickly to sustain that as the total market opens back up. And then we've been seeing where we have really changed the cadence of our communication dialogue and the way we've set up our digital website to be more relevant to weekly guest needs. We're really connecting with customers and driving high double-digit comps in those categories that we're leading into and building real engagement and data with these customers. So I think it's too early to say how high is high. I think the industry in total believes that penetration rates will be increased. We're already on that pathway.

I mean bread makers, blenders and vacuums and cleaning products, water filtration, coffee, coffee, coffee, like -- people are like, hell, we're just going to make the best of it at home. Now that's a boom for us. And we think -- we actually think that as people come out at this moment, we think that some of the data that we're seeing very early, and it's preliminary, there's going to be some discretionary spend move away from specific categories. 
But we believe that people will want to celebrate their home, reinforce it, refresh it, invite friends for smaller moments and build equity in entertaining and start to celebrate the home. And then leading into a Back to College moment, which we're really primed, which is your home away from home, we're really ready to take on that. So I think this kind of new cocooning, new nesting, new love for home and valuing the environment, while we all want to step outside, clearly, I think there's going to be safety as a consideration. And I think there's going to be a love and respect for the home that we're ready to take advantage of.

I think that was one of the first things that Joe and team and Robyn really worked on, was like, hey, great partners, this is going to be tough when we all know we're in a situation we know we're going to be in for the long term. We know we're liquid, we know we're strong, and we have a plan, and just let everybody work together on what we can do here. And so without going into great detail, know that those conversations were very robust, and we've asked for a level of support. It's just short to midterm. It's not the standard way we'll operate. And we'll all work on it together. And we've seen some really good lean-ins there to change that liquidity. And as I said, some of the burn rates we talked about earlier were not inclusive of those actions taking hold yet. So that's a further benefit to cash flow. 
But yes, look, it was on our to-do list very early on, and we began in earnest to sit with our partners and renegotiate just in the short to mid how we can play with terms and how we can work.

As Janet said, we are coming together tonight from remote locations, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us under these unprecedented circumstances. 
Frankly, it seems like a different place and time. Life as we knew it before March is a distant memory. We are in the moment now, and I'd like to start by discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll talk about the strategic actions we are taking in this moment to build momentum around our transformation plans. Then Robyn will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide some further context around the potential impacts from the pandemic. 
Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers and our teams. We are providing essential infant, health and personal care items to local communities through our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores as well as serving the rest of our loyal customers online through our digital channels. Our teams are working around the clock to provide these essential products to our customers and to ensure the supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible. I would like to take a minute to personally thank our associate teams on behalf of management and the Board. We thank you for your above-and-beyond service, attitude and dedication to our company and our loyal customers despite this extremely challenging situation. Making it easy to feel at home means different things to different people, and our teams have been working incredibly hard to support our customers. I also want to say thank you to our loyal customers and assure you that we will continue to work hard to help you access the essential products we sell as you manage through these very difficult times. 
In this moment, we are focused on facilitating and coordinating our ongoing response to the current pandemic. There is no historical playbook for this situation, but we have a remarkable team, robust contingency plans and a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to navigate this unprecedented challenge with confidence. We quickly initiated our contingency plan, creating an essential response unit with emergency task force groups to focus on several priority areas, including our people, operations, customers, technology and our finances. While this situation is like nothing we've seen before, we are adapting as necessary and taking decisive actions to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers and strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility. This is an important time for us now and moving forward. Bed Bath & Beyond can play an important role in supporting customers and their families in making it easy to feel at home. 
All but approximately 170 of our buybuy BABY and Harmon stores are now temporarily closed at least until May 2. We continue to provide essential products such as infant, health and personal care items in store, subject to state and local regulations, and online through our various digital channels. We are rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. They are relying on us more than ever to deliver essential products directly to their home. 
All 4 of our e-commerce fulfillment centers are currently operating. And by the end of this week, we will have converted approximately 25% of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers to use our vast inventory resources to assign orders locally and deliver quickly. 
With these conversions, we expanded our fulfillment capacity significantly. The regional fulfillment stores have doubled the capacity of our entire fulfillment network, facilitating approximately 44% of our overall daily orders with almost 40% of these orders being fulfilled within 50 miles of the customers' home. This has been an incredible learning curve for us, and we continue to optimize our regional fulfillment capabilities to deliver faster and at lower cost. 
While our supply chain is moving quickly to support our digital business in real time, rerouting products from the chain to DCs and regional fulfillment stores, our technology team has stood up a 24-hour group to continuously refine the order allocation logic between the fulfillment stores and DCs. Our buying team is rerouting store on orders to the regional fulfillment locations and DCs while at the same time canceling purchase orders and modifying receipt forecasts to reduce store inventory levels. 
On the consumer-facing side, our teams are closely monitoring top sellers and adjusting quickly to get products that our customers need and partnering with our vendors to help keep us in stock and well positioned. I want to thank all of our business partners for their efforts and collaboration during this time. 
This kind of strategic action and innovation has allowed us to quickly implement curbside pickup, which was launched April 1 at buybuy BABY. In the first full week alone, we completed more than 11,000 curbside orders. We're also introducing curbside pickup at our Harmon stores later this week. Also this week, we are rolling our Buy Online Pick Up In Store at our BABY stores. We are quickly learning how our customers want to shop with us, and we will continue to evolve the process digitally to create a best-in-class experience. Both BOPIS and curbside pickup will be rolled out to our Bed Bath & Beyond stores as a new service offering for our customers where we can safely reopen. These new services were fast tracked during this period and will significantly enhance our fulfillment capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. 
With the vast majority of our stores temporarily closed, our customer-facing digital channels continue to service our customers, and we are seeing online demand grow significantly. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond digital business is seeing net sales growth of more than 90% for the month of April to date, further strengthening our omnichannel strategic direction. This demand is being facilitated by our agile digital and marketing teams who are working together, responding to consumer data, creating newness and freshness across our sites, highlighting items customers need to make it easy to feel at home and communicating important information about changes in store hours and closures as well as safety measures so that our customers are clear on how we are operating and how they can shop with us. 
As the quarantine phase of this pandemic has taken hold, we are seeing consumer purchasing demand focus on categories such as water filtration, air purifiers, vaporizers and humidifiers as well as kitchen electrics, cleaning and coffee needs. Now over the past month, we sold the equivalent of 10 million cups of coffee and 400% loaf bread makers over the last year. And last week, we sold over 100% more vacuums compared to the same period of time last year. 
This action to temporary close our stores has, of course, fundamentally changed the nature of our business in the short to midterm. The impact on our stores is obvious, but this decision affects the entire company. From IT to merchandising, finance to HR, the shape and structure of our business is radically different in this new environment across concepts and across the country. 
So in this moment, we are taking a holistic approach to managing our financial position, including larger efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen our liquidity. In conjunction with the recent decision to extend the temporary store closures, we implemented several additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of our store associates and a percentage of our corporate associates until at least May 2. Salaries will also reduce for myself and the executive team as well as the Board. We put an immediate stop to $150 million in CapEx spend and put a hold on share repurchases and future dividends. Robyn will provide further detail on our proactive measures in a minute. 
We are balancing our ability to provide jobs and financial support for our associates in the short, medium and long term as well as prioritizing investments designed to strengthen our business. We believe these actions will help us further weather the storm and preserve our financial health for the good of our associates, customers and shareholders. 
If there is a silver lining, I would say that given the monumental changes we've made to our business over the past 4 weeks, our ability to act decisively, partner up and move with speed and agility has been greatly enhanced. I'm very proud of the ideas, inspiration and commitment that all our associates have made to serve our customers and our business. It's been incredible to come together as one united virtual team across the company to work together in ways perhaps that would have not been possible or even thought of in the past. We are leveraging this learning opportunity to be more collaborative and flexible in our focused priorities and then move more quickly so that we are ready to welcome our customers back when we can safely reopen our stores.
We have also provided much-needed support for local communities, serving food and care packages to seniors, military personnel and their families plus children in need from our Christmas Tree Shops stores across the country. And we've donated more than 0.5 million Easter chocolates, candies, cookies, baskets and toys to dozens of local charities, shelters, schools and community organizations nationwide from over 250 of our Cost Plus World Market stores. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter, which just seem like a lifetime ago. In short, the pressures of store traffic trends and heavy promotional activity, coupled with the inventory management issues around the holiday selling period, hampered our efforts to stabilize the business in the fourth quarter. These trends are consistent with the information we provided on February 11 when we issued preliminary financial data for the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. 
Product availability with certain key promotional categories, such as kitchen electrics, leading into the holiday period were either too low or just out of stock. We just didn't have enough of the right stuff, which hurt us. We are confident this is fully rectifiable in terms of our learning plan and implementation from now until the back half of fiscal 2020. 
Our fourth quarter results were also pressured by heavier clearance activity during the quarter as we rapidly actioned on our strategic inventory reduction program. Now we surpassed the halfway mark of this initiative and are pleased with our progress. It's important to note that prior to this current business environment, we were sharpening our focus on inventory, ending the fourth quarter with approximately 16% less retail inventory at cost on an adjusted basis versus a year ago so operating leaner and on a lower SKU base. We are now focusing our attention on optimizing our merchandising mix, which of course is a key focus for our new Chief Merchant, Joe Hartsig. 
For the full fourth quarter, we also reported a positive shift in sales across our digital channel with a return to strong growth of about 16%. Sales in our mobile channels for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY each grew more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and orders taken through our mobile app were up over 75%. These quarterly results strengthened our resolve to continue to make necessary bold and broad-based changes needed to modernize our business and gives us confidence about our ability to improve upon this quarterly performance. This includes the strategic restructuring program we implemented in late February to reduce annual SG&A expense by approximately $85 million and reset our cost structure. 
Prior to COVID-19, we had solid strategic plans for fiscal 2020. In this moment, we need to be agile and focused on simplifying and strengthening our business where it matters most to our customers and reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Let me now address the issues at hand and what we are working on. First, recruiting talent remains a top priority. We have an extensive interview process underway for the open roles. We have made bold moves. We have a robust process and have identified key candidates, with Joe Hartsig being the first major appointment as our new Chief Merchandising Officer. There will be more news on other great talent to come in the coming weeks. I'm excited to welcome Joe to the team. He has more than 30 years of experience in consumer brand development and retail merchandising with well-known consumer businesses like Walgreens, Walmart, Motorola and SC Johnson. To me, Joe is a merchant's merchant. And I'm looking to him to be a leader and a teacher as we rebuild our business, including improving key items in stocks and improving curation and further differentiation of our assortment, which is our #1 priority. 
Second, we remain focused on generating funds from the sale of assets and simplifying our business. In addition to the previously announced sale-leaseback transaction, we recently sold the One Kings Lane business to a third party for an undisclosed amount. As previously disclosed, we ended into a definitive agreement to sell our PersonalizationMall.com business to 1-800-FLOWERS for $252 million. 1-800 was required to close the transaction on March 30 but breached its obligation to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require them to close and intend to vigorously enforce our rights. While we can make no assurances, we will continue to pursue other portfolio adjustments and evaluate the remaining owned real estate in an effort to create a stronger and more focused portfolio. 
Lastly and most importantly, we are driving our strategic growth plans. Under the current business environment, we have modified our capital investments, but we'll continue to invest with confidence where it matters most. We now plan to invest about $250 million focusing on our core business and key projects that support the omnichannel future of our company in 2020 and beyond, which are more relevant than ever, such as our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including BOPIS and curbside pickup, omni inventory management as well as digital marketing and personalization. 
At a high level, we are reengineering our supply chain and our vendor relationships as well as further strengthening our owned-brand strategy. We are postponing store remodels due to the coronavirus situation and the timing issues it's created as we don't want to interfere with the critical third and fourth quarter holiday period in 2020. We will also continue to review our store footprint as we have nearly 250 leases that are up for renewal in 2020 alone, which gives us added financial flexibility. In technology, we'll continue to invest in order allocation logic to better leverage our stores and fulfillment centers and improve our site speed and checkout experience in addition to simplifying the process. 
Now we have postponed our plans for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction to preserve our financial position and retain financial flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to longer term, and we will reevaluate when appropriate. Now is the time to stay liquid until we have more clarity on the global situations surrounding COVID-19. All the steps we've taken since I arrived at the company 5 short months ago, including this COVID-19 moment, reinforce our preliminary strategic plan focused on a singular purpose, to make it easy to feel at home. 
Our strategy will deliver against 5 key pillars, namely product, price, promise, place and people. We believe this strategy is more relevant today than ever and will support significant improvement in our financial performance and a deeper connection with our loyal customers. In this time, when home is even more central to our lives and being safe at home with family is essential, Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home. We will provide inspiration and a curated, affordable assortment so that our customers can create a home they love. 
Now before turning the call over to Robyn, I just wanted to mention that we have previously planned to host an investor event this spring. And now under these circumstances, we are exploring other options, including potentially a virtual event, to take place at a more suitable time. We'll want to introduce you to the new team, showcase some of our new capabilities and early results and lay out our longer-term strategic growth objectives for the business. We'll keep you updated on our plans. 
While we deal with the immediate priorities, we continue our work to drive the company forward. We have robust contingency plans, and I am confident that we are able to navigate this crisis. We have an iconic brand with great consumer brand loyalty, and we're taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with our customers as we strengthen our omni-always approach. I believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet. 
Robyn will now review our fourth quarter results and then provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures we have taken to date to protect our financial position and maintain flexibility. I will then come back for some closing remarks.

I hope you are all faring well under these very unusual circumstances. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.92 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter includes an unfavorable impact of $0.91 per diluted share for special items, including $41 million in severance costs related to the strategic restructuring program initiated in February 2020 and the extensive leadership changes announced in December 2019; a noncash charge of approximately $35 million for the impairment of certain store level assets; a noncash charge of approximately $33 million for the impairment of certain trade names and other assets; and an expense of $33 million related to the loss on the sale-leaseback transaction announced in January 2020. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.38. 
The remainder of my review of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis, as applicable, consistent with our prior disclosures to better represent year-over-year performance of the business during the comparative period. From this year's fourth quarter, we exclude the items I just mentioned, along with the related impact on the provision for income taxes. And from last year's fourth quarter, we exclude the $510 million pretax goodwill impairment charge and the related impact on the provision for income taxes. As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending February 29 and included the Cyber Monday holiday week, while our fourth quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending March 2 and did not include the Cyber Monday holiday week. 
On February 11, we reported preliminary unaudited financial performance data for the first 2 months of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We shared this update to provide visibility into the then current pressures on our business, including store traffic declines, combined with inventory management issues and the impact on revenue and margin resulting from increased promotional activity and markdowns. 
Net sales in the quarter were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 6.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Comp sales for the quarter decreased 5.6%, reflecting a high single-digit decline in the number of transactions partially offset by a low single-digit increase in the average transaction amount. On a directional basis, comp sales from our stores declined about 10%, while comp sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 16%. Similar to last quarter, our sales in the fourth quarter were positively modified by the calendar shift of the Cyber Monday holiday week. Adjusting for this calendar shift to exclude the Cyber Monday holiday week in both periods, our comp sales for the quarter declined 11%, with a decline in store sales of 13.6% and growth in digital sales of 1.1%. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% of net sales as compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 210 basis point decline was primarily due to an unfavorable impact on merchandise margins from promotional activity and markdowns. In addition, we had an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense due to the higher penetration of digital sales within the total mix of quarterly sales. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was 30.7% of net sales as compared to 28.2% of net sales in the prior year period. This 250 basis point increase in SG&A, in order of magnitude, was primarily due to about 100 basis points of consulting expense associated with our efforts to expedite the ongoing transformation initiatives and review of assets and an increase in advertising expense, including digital marketing, related to the heavy promotional activity in the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effect of fixed costs such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation on a lower sales base. 
Our quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.3% on an adjusted basis and included $8.3 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring during the quarter. As a result of the lower pretax earnings base in the fourth quarter, these net after-tax benefits have a greater impact on the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year on an adjusted basis was 19.7% and included approximately $8.9 million of net after-tax benefits due to distinct events occurring in that quarter. 
Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong cash position with about $1.4 billion in cash and investments, including over $250 million in net proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed during the quarter. Adjusted retail inventories of $2.1 billion at cost, excluding a charge for markdowns associated with our inventory reduction initiative, reflected a significant reduction of about 16% or over $400 million at cost at the end of the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period. We continue to action against our previously communicated $1 billion inventory reduction program at retail, and we are now about halfway through the program and plan to continue to work down the remaining inventory in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures for the year were $277 million, with nearly 50% of the expense related to technology projects primarily focused on logistics, digital capabilities and analytics. The remaining CapEx expense was primarily related to investments in stores, including remodels and new store openings. We closed 26 stores and opened 2 stores during the quarter. 
Regarding share repurchase activity, there were no open market repurchases during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have suspended repurchasing of our shares while conducting the review of our retail portfolio and real estate assets. The company currently remains committed to its capital return program over the mid to long term and will reevaluate when appropriate. To clarify, our previously announced first quarter dividend was paid on April 14 and was not impacted by the temporary suspension. 
Moving on to fiscal 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will, of course, be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. We're monitoring the situation closely regarding our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. 
We ended fiscal 2019 with cash and investments of $1.4 billion. And while we feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we plan to take or are taking proactive steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, such as drawing down the additional $236 million of available funds remaining from our revolving credit facility; suspended our plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction; postponed $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020, including some store remodels; furloughed the majority of our workforce, including store and corporate associates, until at least May 2; temporarily reduce the salaries of our executive team, including myself and Mark, by 30%; temporarily reduced the quarterly cash compensation of our independent Board of Directors by 30%; reducing discretionary spend, such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with maintenance of stores that are temporarily closed; renegotiating extensions of payment terms for goods and services and rents; managing to lower inventory levels; and implementing applicable benefits of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. 
Considering these circumstances, while we have trimmed CapEx by $150 million, we are now prioritizing approximately $250 million in essential capital expenditures to drive our strategic growth plans, as Mark described a few minutes ago. In addition, our capital structure provides further flexibility, including the potential to utilize significant balance sheet assets to generate incremental liquidity if needed. As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we had approximately $2 billion of quality, primarily nonseasonal inventory on our balance sheet, which has not been pledged as collateral under our existing debt arrangements. These actions, together with our strategic efforts to reset the organization's cost structure including the recent restructuring program and our strong balance sheet, put us in a better position to manage through this period of uncertainty. We remain committed to keeping our shareholders informed about the business and our strategy to reestablish our authority in the home space. 
Now I would like to provide some context around the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, the full impact of this situation won't be known for months. However, what's important right now is that we are proactively managing the immediate challenges and playing an important role for our customers. As of Friday, March 20, we had temporarily closed over 50% of our stores across all banners until April 3. The approximately 700 stores that remained open in operation were stores that sell essential items such as health care, personal care, infant care, cleaning supplies or food and beverages. The following week, the company announced that it was temporarily closing all retail banners across the U.S. and Canada other than buybuy BABY and Harmon stores, subject to state and local regulations. This left about 170 of our 1,500 stores in operation to provide the essential items we sell to customers. On April 2, we extended the temporary store closures until May 2. 
For the month of March, while we have not yet finalized our monthly results, we do have visibility to our sales performance. For the March period, we are able to share preliminary unaudited financial performance data. Overall, net sales across all banners were down approximately 31% versus the prior year March period. This was led by a decline of about 41% in store sales, as expected, due to less customer in-store shopping, resulting from self-quarantine guidelines and the initiation of temporary store closures and limited store hours. Net sales from our digital channels, however, were strong in March, up about 16%, benefiting from an increase in digital shopping due to COVID-19 and further enhancements we have made in our fulfillment capabilities, including converting about 25% of our temporary closed stores to regional fulfillment stores, as Mark spoke about earlier. The sales performance for both buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores, which remain open to provide essential items, was better than the overall company for the March period. 
Through the first 2 weeks of April, the fiscal quarter-to-date overall decline in our total net sales is around 42% primarily due to the additional temporary store closures. However, net sales from our digital channels have further strengthened with year-over-year growth of more than 35%. Due to the level of market uncertainty, we will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time. 
As we work through 2020, we believe our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. Our strong cash position, along with our near-term actions, provide the company with continued financial resilience and ample short and midterm liquidity to fund the operations of the business. To reiterate what Mark said earlier, we do believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our balance sheet.

As Robyn shared, we have tremendous opportunities to build and manage a modern, durable business model to capture long-term sustainable growth. We'll be driving meaningful and inspiring engagements with our customers, refining and amplifying an exciting omnichannel assortment, providing compelling value through price and differentiation and delivering an omni-always shopping experience that serves our customers' needs. And we will continually look for ways to optimize our business model, whether through the supply chain or through other operating efficiencies across the business. We'll also take advantage of the market dislocation that has already occurred and that will likely to continue, resulting in changes in the competitive landscape and opportunities for us to grow market share in the home, baby and personal care spaces. This time has been a test for all retailers. We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is positioned to come out stronger as we have the cash, the talent, the right plans and great, loyal customers. 
I would like to finish where I started: by giving my heartfelt thanks to our teams who are going above and beyond to serve our company and our loyal customer base during this critical moment. I also wish all of you listening today continued safety and good health.

I think, Bobby, this is a really fluid moment, and we are really pleased with the work we've done to date. What Robyn's outlined earlier is in terms of the compensation decisions, the renegotiation on terms, managing receipt flow, postponing CapEx and the suspension on shares and repurchases. I mean we've got hundreds of millions of dollars that we've saved. So our cash burn to date has been controlled, and we're really happy with that. But we see even further activity in the subsequent weeks that we're able to action as we're now on full furlough. And this is before we've even drawn down on any other potential facilities. So we're liquid to start with. We have further liquidity available, and our cash burn has been really controlled. 
One of the things we did do early on was bringing in a third-party consultant to really help us with a scenario planning of short-, mid- and long-term closures due to COVID and to manage our cash flow proposition by day, by week.

Look, I mean, Michael, on the opening, no crystal ball here for Mark Tritton. But here's what I would say to you. We are -- we've moved from a now to a next to a future proposition in terms of our strategic planning. And while we are securing our current scenario and managing our teams, we are working on the reemergence and the reentry into the market and how that plays out. We don't have that time down, but we have multiple scenarios. We really tapped into major groups like [ Reeler ], who are doing a fantastic job in terms of sharing data and working with government to establish what reentry looks like. And to your point, Michael, I do think that it will be a region-by-region-based response. We'll be part of a bevy of retailers that follow the guidelines of government and come back into the market only when it's safe for our teams and our customers, and we're following those guidelines strictly. 
Now when that is, we factored in our financial models on multiple scenarios, including a very elongated period. We feel really comfortable in terms of our cash burn and our liquidity as a result without touching any further available funds. And so we've looked at the map, and we've looked at the time frame. The actual date we will be ready -- and as we've talked about, we've already accelerated a number of capabilities during this downtime like BOPIS, like curbside pickup and like store fulfill that we think are actually going to really sustain and benefit our total business, including the digital -- great digital growth we've been seeing through the fourth quarter and now into Q1.

I know you just said that, look, you obviously do have a lot of cash on the books, additional liquidity. You said you've taken through multiple scenarios where even on a long-dated basis, you're pretty comfortable. But could you give a little more detail in terms of what the time line is? And given the things that you've done like probably getting concessions on rents, furloughing 80% of the labor force, halting some CapEx, all those things, it's got to put you in at least a reasonable position to manage. So any more detail on that is important.

Look, I mean, that's why we're sharing a lot of these points. Liquidity is definitely there, and we took really early steps to control our costs and move forward. I mean to kind of lean into a little bit more, Curt, I would tell you that while we've been still working on the exit towards furlough and the negotiations, we're immediately able to cap off more than 40% of our weekly cash burn rate immediately. And we're implementing further plans through based on what Robyn and I shared. So we've got strong controls there. Our modeling, we, like everybody, and I mean we've been talking to our financial advisers as well as [ Reeler ] and the people I shared with, we've looked at an April scenario and a May scenario and an August scenario and an indefinite scenario. And in all of those, we've got really clear math about our sustainability and liquidity plus the availability to draw down on other facilities. So we've got controlled cash burn, we have cash, and we have a plan. 
Now this is not something that is years and years and years in the making. I think everyone is looking at this in these very short synapses but also looking at the worst-case scenarios. When we sat down with our Board and shared our worst-case scenarios, we have good liquidity, and we have stability in our business with the right actions taken to take us through. And I think we're in a really unusual position, Curt, in that we don't have rotting fruit in terms of our merchandise. We're primarily seasonless. We're not an apparel business, and we have sustainable product that we can leverage upon reentry, and we're not going to be in a blood bath in terms of cost. 
So there are some real benefits to this space. And there's no doubt that the home business has become very fruitful in this period. We just need the customers to be able to access us and other retailers and products in a more fluid way, which is an omnichannel environment of true digital and physical stores.

I think for us, it was tough to hit the COVID moment when we just saw some pivots happening in February. We knew we were plagued by issues in December and January, would be transparent around that. Some of it was self-inflicted. I mean when we don't have best sellers in stock, we've got discounting and we don't have our inventory. I mean some of the sales decline we saw in our stores wasn't necessarily traffic. We did some intel work on that, saw the customers were coming in, and they just couldn't find the product in stock. So we were shooting ourselves in the foot. That is easily rectifiable, and we started to do that straight at the end of January. 
We saw positive comps coming through or more positive comps in terms of churn rate in February. And as we stated, we saw an acceleration of our digital business. It was doing well during the period, but that accelerated even further. So we've been seeing our full year '19 business, we were about 19% penetration in digital in total. For the fourth quarter alone, that was up to 21.3%, and we had double-digit comps there. Now we've seen that digital business even more deeply accelerate with a lot of new customers, about 31%, 33% of our customers in this Q1 period being new to the Bed Bath & Beyond websites, buybuy BABY websites, et cetera. So we're garnering new business, and we're building plans with BOPIS, curbside and personalization to sustain those relationships. 
So we're excited, if that's a word I can even use in this moment, about what lies ahead. But it definitely was some gentle momentum coming our way that was positive in February that belied the December-January trends. And then we hit these goals at the moment.

What we've seen is these very sharp synapses. And one of the things that Robyn was outlining is the periods in which we were partially open then closed and then -- particularly in Bed Bath and then relying heavily on the digital business. We've seen strong conversion. It's never going to map out to be full coverage of our stores-based business. But we are seeing both demand and total sales in the 70%, 80% and 90% mark when we move into the April period. And as we mentioned, really ramping up and flexing with agility our capability to fulfill those orders, both in the stores that we're using as regional fulfillment centers as well as our DCs, have been tremendous. So we're meeting guest needs. We're working with them. We're fulfilling orders. We're working through our inventory, and we're building equity in our omni-always business.

I think our mix is very fluid at the moment. I'm -- clearly, people are leaning into cleaning, into kitchen, into baking, into home care. And so this is a great time for us. Our textile business is not as strong, and that's something that we see coming forward as people look to refresh their home. We think this is going to be -- if people have been staring at the same 4 walls for a month or 2 now, Simeon, I think the idea of refreshing your bathroom, your bedroom, your kitchen, that's going to be pivotal in terms of some of the engagement of customers and how they return into the market more than maybe an apparel purchase or definitely a travel purchase. 
So discretionary spending, I think, will be focused, and we may be a strong beneficiary there. So margin is balanced. And what we see is that our digital business always performs at a much lower coupon rate. And therefore, at this point, we're getting a really balanced response there. I think that the -- we see online acceleration. I think there are a lot of people who are talking around that. And I think the great thing about that is that -- some of the changes we've most recently made in terms of fulfillment and support. I mean not having BOPIS versus the rest of the industry has been an Achilles' heel. We were set to launch that in full in May in stores, and we've maintained that spend and commitment to be ready when our doors do open. And then have also added in curbside. And now we've stood up store fulfill, which was something that we had on our agenda, but we wanted to get through the other pieces first. We've accelerated those. And as you talked about that in terms of the impact, I'm no stranger with previous employers on the margin mix that a store fulfill via order or BOPIS can do in terms of the math and the margin on digital. So we'll start to model that out. 
Now is not the time to get accurate about that, but we believe that's positive things that lie ahead for us. And then we've already begun to convert some discretionary merchandise into more of an owned brand platform ahead of a major relaunch in 2021 at the start.

Look, I mean I think that we entered into promotional activity in a way that we hadn't ever before, Seth. I think that if we go back to the end of the third quarter, start of the fourth quarter, it was the first time we'd ever really been truly promotional out by the coupon. And we really didn't lay down the plans to get there in the right way. So we burnt the margin and we burnt a lot of inventory and weren't prepared to get back into stock. So they're kind of tough learnings. But they're also redeemable moments that we can translate into new actions. 
I think that the one thing that I've noticed coming into the business and have been working with the team on is the role of value and price/value equation. I think that we know that customers don't want to do the math, and they want to have simple, readable affordability. And I think that's what we're missing from our equation. Both in-store and online, we haven't been making value. And I don't mean just sharp price. I mean the resonating true value to the customer has been a little bit difficult in places than how we've operated. And so we've learned a ton of what not to do. And as a result, you're going to see coming through in our digital channel a refresh of how we're presenting value and talking to our guests with clarity and simplicity. You'll see that roll through circulars. And then when we open up, you'll start to see it manifest in things like end caps and price point presentation and real clear, understandable everyday value. 
So we -- there's no doubt that as we come out of this COVID-19 moment and with unemployment and some tough times ahead, customers want to be able to get value, see value, understand value and have it resonate with them quickly. And we think we've got some great plans in place to really step into that. And that doesn't mean giving away the margin farm, it just means being really clear on our intent upfront.

Look, I mean I think it's less about the stability and more about the long-term benefits. And really, we were just talking about postponing. We're not talking about canceling. The major one really there, Seth, is around the store remodel programs. I've been working on -- since I joined on a program with the team, we've got 3 test stores that are showing really positive signs of growth from the core model, and that was without any assortment changes. Just -- and any of the price point changes and clarity that we talked about. So refreshment of the stores is something we then fast tracked. And we're ready to roll out 25, 26 stores to really give us a model to accelerate our spend in subsequent years. Now that was going to take place and be ready on or before the beginning of the Back to College period so we didn't interrupt with our key selling period. And then in Q3, Q4, we would have been done. 
Having to ice those at the moment was really tough because we had some good work that we wanted to put into play. But it would have been crazy to spend that money, disrupt Q3 and Q4 and wanting to preserve some CapEx. So we've got the plans, we've got the info, and we've got the dream. We're just going to finesse that further as we get ready to implement that in early 2021. So it's postponed, not canceled.

Look, I mean, a couple of things there. I think that we've been -- Joe has been leading the charge here and having deep conversation with all our majors and our general vendor bases about flow. If you go back to the inventory position that we had, there's kind of 2 things going there. The good news was that overall, we reduced our inventory by about 16% at the close of the quarter. And so we were working leaner on that. But inside of that, we did have big misses not by having more inventory, we think that's a good level that we can come down to, but we could have traded some of our mix to be more in stock about key items and generated more sales and gross margin by having the right merchandise. So again, the level coming down is a positive. The curation within the level becomes critical. Joe has really lend into that charge, getting it back in stock about top 100, 250, 500 items and making sure that we can draw that down. I think also getting the flexibility to draw the stock from different places helps us to kind of speed up sales and get clarity and delivery to the customer on time. 
In terms of the point around the commitments, we quickly moved into an evaluation of high-risk merchandise, seasonal merchandise and anything that kind of -- if we looked at our long-term plan of what could have been a close at hold, really looking at minimizing our quantification of risk and adjusting flow. So that's a very fluid discussion, a very real discussion. And that began on day 1 when we started to see the problem emerge. So it's a real strength in having Joe on board, focusing on this. And our overall inventory plans are really highlighted by being in stock of best sellers, getting our preplan with our vendors in place so that we could get that in stock and we play out the third and fourth quarter in a different way and then keeping a close eye on seasonality and flow of merchandise from offshore vendors.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I think in general, in the industry, the consensus that I've been seeing, Jonathan, is that everyone is planning for -- I mean this is not going to be a light switch moment where everything goes back to the immediate moment. We have got -- our financial plans are very conservative when I talked about the modeling in terms of an expectation of a highly reduced sales level so that we can work out our financial plan to be as liquid as possible no matter what. And so there's a number of percentages being bandied around there. I'm not going to contribute to the dialogue other than to say we have multiple scenarios, and some of them quite deep, to ensure that we've got our liquidity in place even if the return is there. 
Our general -- I think there's going to be different rules here. I think you've got to remember that -- I think that this is -- we're looking at a lot of the recessionary moments from the past as models. But you also have the fear factor of safety inside piece. So large gatherings, shopping at the mall, those things become more questionable maybe for others. So less than 10% of our fleet is mall-based. We're big box, and we're independent. We think that will work in our favor, and that helps us to do things like curbside pickup and the fluidity of BOPIS much faster than maybe a mall-based retailer. And we think there'll be a gradual turn on, but we also think there will be categories that come back faster. And I think that home will be a beneficiary much faster than apparel. And we think that there's some positive upside to establishing relationships and transactions with customers early, but we know it's going to be graded.

Look, I mean we've already identified and are moving forward on those strategies. So that remains unchanged with this moment, and I want to be really clear around that. A couple of things there, Brad. I think the first thing that we noticed, and we just talked about value earlier on the call, is that we have some real gaps in opening price point and the clarity of communication around value to our customers. So we're leaning into that space. I think the second piece is around really reducing a high level of duplication in items. And we really want to focus on a curation of differentiation and relevance to our customer. And where we've done that, we've seen real wins. In some of these stores that I was talking about earlier that I was playing with the models on, we've reduced the SKU count by 20% to 30%, and we were seeing double-digit comps at the same time. So when we curate, we make our assortment more focused and understandable. 
And then I've just been working even today on -- with Joe on a number of really great owned brands that we're cultivating and getting ready to launch at the start of next fiscal year because these things take time, and we're developing newness there, which will help reframe out each of the key rooms and categories and occasions that we are currently dominant in and have strong market share but also ones where we want to cultivate. So I think that there's a modernity and a freshness and a relevance and an affordability in that home and personal care space as well as our efforts inside BABY, which were well underway. That can really create more relevant merchandise assortment. So we're upturning a lot of rocks there. We're renegotiating costs across the board, which had already been done and worked on. 
So there's a margin upside, there's a mix upside, and then there's a perception upside, including value, that we see coming. And that will be evolutionary throughout the rest of 2020, and you're really going to see some strong green shoots in late 2020, early 2021.",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

It's a great question. I mean, look, I mean I think we really would have been hitting on some high double-digit comps. And I think that we had to restrain some demand based on availability of inventory, especially in key items. And so those items are strong. They're not markdown-driven. That would have been a real boom for us, Seth. And I think that bodes well for where we can cut and paste those experiences into benefits in third and fourth quarter in 2020. 
The upside of it, I think, is also going to be distorted by the current behavior in COVID-19. And that's why I'm really excited about the fact that we've built background capabilities very quickly to sustain that as the total market opens back up. And then we've been seeing where we have really changed the cadence of our communication dialogue and the way we've set up our digital website to be more relevant to weekly guest needs. We're really connecting with customers and driving high double-digit comps in those categories that we're leading into and building real engagement and data with these customers. So I think it's too early to say how high is high. I think the industry in total believes that penetration rates will be increased. We're already on that pathway.

I think that was one of the first things that Joe and team and Robyn really worked on, was like, hey, great partners, this is going to be tough when we all know we're in a situation we know we're going to be in for the long term. We know we're liquid, we know we're strong, and we have a plan, and just let everybody work together on what we can do here. And so without going into great detail, know that those conversations were very robust, and we've asked for a level of support. It's just short to midterm. It's not the standard way we'll operate. And we'll all work on it together. And we've seen some really good lean-ins there to change that liquidity. And as I said, some of the burn rates we talked about earlier were not inclusive of those actions taking hold yet. So that's a further benefit to cash flow. 
But yes, look, it was on our to-do list very early on, and we began in earnest to sit with our partners and renegotiate just in the short to mid how we can play with terms and how we can work.

Good afternoon, everyone. As Janet said, we are speaking with you tonight from a remote location. I'd like to welcome you all to our call.  
I'm happy to be here and excited for you to hear from some of our new leadership team, as Janet described. Our presentation agenda for today includes an update on the strategic focus of the business, including our near-term actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our approach to store reopenings. Next, Gustavo will review our first quarter financial results. Then Jim will give us an update on the strategic focus of our operations, and Joe will do the same from a commercial perspective. We will then take questions.  
The first half of 2020 has been extraordinary by any measure. No one could have anticipated the scale of the impact from this pandemic on this global economy and our own North American business [indiscernible] on the amount of decisions we would have to make to keep our people, customers and communities safe. I'm very proud of how our teams came together to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action. These decisions have not been easy, and we are aware of their consequences, especially for those of our associates impacted by the furlough. But I believe our response was the right one for the short, medium and long-term health of our people and our business.  
Throughout the quarter, we remain hyper-focused on ensuring liquidity and optimizing costs, including actions to improve cash flow generation. We swiftly implemented various actions to maintain our financial flexibility, including a tight control on operating expenses, managing our inventory, postponing some capital investments and suspending our capital allocation plans for share repurchase, debt reduction and quarterly dividends. We succeeded in controlling our monthly cash burn and ended the quarter in a strong cash investment position of $1.2 billion. Last month, after the quarter close, we further strengthened our liquidity with a new 3-year $850 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We are confident about our financial position and their ability to manage through these uncertain times.  
While we have been managing through this difficult environment, we have not lost focus on our strategic imperative to rebuild our authority in the home space. We continue to make strong progress and even accelerated several elements of our transformation assets. Importantly, we onboarded 5 new senior leaders during the quarter, which was no small feat: Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; John Hartmann, Chief Operating Officer and President of buybuy BABY; Rafeh Masood, Chief Digital Officer; Arlene Hong, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Sectary; and Cindy Davis, our new Chief Brand Officer and President of Decorist. These 5 joined Joe Hartsig, our Chief Merchandising Officer and President of Harmon Stores, who joined in March; and Gregg Melnick, Chief Stores Officer, who was appointed to his new role in May and previously served as our interim Chief Digital Officer. I spent many months supported by the Board, meeting candidates who have the right skills, experience and character to take our business to the next level. Our diverse team of highly experienced retail experts is complete. I'm delighted to finally have them all on board to accelerate the pace of transformation.  
Now from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, we've prioritized the health and safety of our team, customers and communities. We closed the vast majority of our retail banner stores on March 23 across the U.S. and Canada, excluding MIS buybuy BABY and Harmon Face and Value stores. As a result, nearly 90% of our locations remain closed during the majority of the quarter, leading to a 49% decline in net sales. This was a critical moment, and we needed to act quickly. It was an important opportunity for us to pivot to a new model and support changing customer preferences and our omni-always approach. Now with the vast majority of our stores closed, we realigned our network and converted 25% of our total store fleet into regional fulfillment centers, nearly doubling our fulfillment capacity to handle the dramatic shift in demand to our own digital channels and unlock store inventory.  
Building on our fulfillment capabilities, we accelerated the pre-planned rollout of our Buy Online, Pick up In-Store or BOPUS and Curbside Pickup services offered in April, which is one of the key highlights of the quarter, especially for our buybuy BABY banner. As John will discuss in a few minutes, this was a game changer for us as it allowed us to restart operations and serve customers at locations that were still closed to the public. By the time we ended the quarter in late May, we were offering BOPUS and Curbside Pickup at nearly 60% of our store locations. These new capabilities powered digital sales growth of more than 100% during the month of April and May. Net sales from our digital channels grew 82% in the first quarter and therefore, represented nearly 2/3 of total net sales.  
Digital growth was also favorably impacted. By the way, we pivoted our merchandising and marketing plans and how we engage with our customers, including more frequent updates through our website to say current and relevant. Joe will talk more about this in a few minutes, but a key highlight for us was the strong growth we saw in new customer acquisition through our digital channels. Nearly 40% of our online orders were placed by customers who are new to ordering online with us, and over 10% of them were also completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond. In late May, we began taking measured steps to reopen stores to the public, including the launch of our store safety plan to help ensure customers can shop in our stores confidently. During the past month, the pace of store reopenings has accelerated in line with changing local and state regulations, market data and the wider retail landscape.  
Our strong financial flexibility allowed us to implement a market-by-market approach, while we invest in rebuilding our business and introducing new services for our customers. I want to thank our dedicated teams for helping us resume operations safely and welcoming back our loyal customers. We are proud of our teams and how quickly they adapted and took decisive actions to keep our people safe and deliver for our customers. 
As of today, nearly all our stores have reopened to the public, and we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We're seeing good results across our reopened stores, and it's clear from the feedback we're hearing, the customers are delighted to be able to again shop in our stores and are taking advantage of the new BOPUS and curbside services. At the same time, we continue to see gradual recovery in weekly sales trends across our digital channels and growth, consistently more than 80% during the month of June. It is still early in the reopening process and the virus and its impact are still unpredictable, but we're encouraged by our customer support and response so far.  
This COVID moment has provided many learnings that we are capitalizing on as we continue to track against our strategic objectives. As previously stated, we have grounded our strategic framework in 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people. You'll hear more about the product, price and place pillars today from John and Joe.  
With these 5 pillars our guide, we've embraced a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. To start, we redefined our purpose to make it easy to feel at home. This is a defining role of our business place for our customers, the north star that guides all our actions. To achieve this purpose, our mission is to reestablish our authority and be the preferred home destination driven by teams consistently delivering balanced, durable growth. We believe this mission is more relevant today than ever when home is everything and being safe at home with family is essential. Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home.  
In addition to the pillar strategies, we're also focused on investing and improving core proficiencies, the plumbing of a house that is essential to rebuilding the foundations of our business. This COVID moment also represents an opportunity for us to drive strong actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program. We have accelerated the further alignment of our cost structure with our near-term performance related to the pandemic. These include, among other things, our efforts to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation to address current gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales from stores to digital channels. Furthermore, we plan to close approximately 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores over the next 2 years under our store network optimization project and focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluding related onetime costs. We're also making additional investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.  
As we previously outlined, we are committed to an ongoing review of our noncore business concepts. As of now, we have not factored any future proceeds from potential asset sales, including the sale of PersonalizationMall.com into our internal financial model. We plan to share the details around these actions and other short-term and longer-term goals and objectives during an Investor Day event expected to be held mid to late October of this year. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we don't know if we will host the meeting in person or virtually, but our Investor Relations team will share more detailed information later this summer.  
I will now turn the call over to Gustavo to review our first quarter results in detail. Gustavo?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I look forward to continuing interactions with our analysts and investor community over the weeks and months to come. 
I've been on the job around 2 months now, which in pandemic time feels more like 2 years. I have been delighted to join Bed Bath & Beyond's team and look forward to help strengthen a sustainable business model for our company. We have an iconic brand, so I was attracted by the challenge and the opportunity of transforming the company to restore relevance in the minds and homes of customers.  
Since I joined in May, our team has been intensively focused on ensuring liquidity and driving cost interventions as we manage our operations during the COVID crisis. This was achieved as we pivoted the company to a predominantly digital business while the majority of our stores were temporarily closed.  
Let me provide some highlights on our fiscal first quarter. First, it's important to note that our quarter span the 3 most critical months to date of the COVID-19 pandemic: March, April and May. In response to this situation, our company acted quickly, prioritizing interventions to maintain liquidity and took actions to control cash burn. Keep in mind that by the time we announced the temporary closure of stores on March 23, we had already paid some monthly expenses such as payroll, rent and other operational costs. So cash management strategies were into effect in conjunction with the store closure announcement in late March. Specifically, we furloughed the majority of our store associates and a portion of corporate associates. We started renegotiating with our vendors for extended payment terms and savings related to goods, services and rent. We proactively manage inventory and cancel purchase orders. And we immediately reduced discretionary spending in areas such as business travel, advertising and expenses associated with the maintenance of stores as well as deferred approximately $150 million in planned capital expenditures. As a result, we successfully lower our monthly cash burn and recorded a strong cash and investment balance of $1.2 billion by end May. And in June, we'll bolster our liquidity with a new $850 million asset-based lending facility, which provides substantial additional liquidity if needed.  
Our net sales were impacted by having the vast majorities of our stores closed during most of the quarter. We operated mainly as a digital business during these months. With this, our gross margin was impacted by channel and product mix, resulting from the substantial shift of sales to our digital channels. 
Let's now look at our monthly cash burn. We entered the quarter in a very strong cash position, coming off a year-end balance of $1.4 billion in cash and investments. In March, we elected to draw down the available $236 million from our unsecured revolving credit facility, which enhanced our cash position. As I said earlier, we have significant cash outflow during the first month. As we move into April, we implemented cash management strategies and carefully manage our inflows and outflows to reduce our cash burn. As we move into May, we were cash neutral, leaving us with a quarter-end balance of $1.2 billion in cash and investments. If we consider the available liquidity under the new ABL facility that we entered into after the quarter closed, we have a total liquidity of more than $1.8 billion in available funds. This is great insurance and provides further financial flexibility as we implement our store reopening plans and focus on driving important actions under the company's strategic transformation plan. 
Now I'll turn to the operational results of the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $2.44 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $2.91 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.48 per diluted share for special items, mostly related to noncash impairments of certain store level assets and trade names. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter net loss per diluted share was $1.96. Consistent with our prior disclosures, the remainder of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis to better represent year-on-year performance of the business. 
Net sales in the quarter were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 49% from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the temporary store closures. On a directional basis, net sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 82%, while net sales from our stores declined about 77%. We experienced a strong digital growth each month of the quarter starting in March, with net sales from our digital channels up 17% as compared to March 2019. The then during April and May, we experienced explosive growth across our digital channels, with net sales up more than 100% each month compared to the same 2 months in 2019. These strong results were supported by rollout and subsequent expansion of our BOPUS and curbside pickup service offerings, not only for Bed Bath & Beyond, but also across our buybuy BABY, Harmon and Cost Plus World Market stores. 
In June, after quarter end, we initiated our phased approach to store reopening, as Mark discussed earlier. As of today, nearly all of our stores are open. And while it is still early days, we're pleased with the customer response. For the month of June, overall net sales decreased only 7%. During this same period, net sales from our digital channels remained strong with year-over-year growth in excess of 80%, while net sales from store declined approximately 25%, reflecting the gradual reopening during the course of the month. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin was 26.7% of net sales as compared to 34.5% last year. This 780 basis point decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact on channel and product mix. In connection with the substantial shift in sales to digital channels. For some context, net sales from our digital channels represented nearly 2/3 of our total quarterly sales compared to penetration of nearly 1/5 in the prior year period. The incremental direct-to-customer shipping expense represented the bulk of the channel mix impact. In addition, higher sales of lower-margin, COVID-essential items contributed to pressure in product mix. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter declined 15% or $123 million compared to the prior year. This decline reflects the impact from actions taken in response to COVID-19, including the associated furlough, lower discretionary spending and benefits from the [ CARE Act ] credits and cost reduction interventions that were initiated at the end of fiscal 2019, such as the corporate restructuring program. As a percentage of net sales, first quarter SG&A significantly increased to 55.3% from 32.9% of net sales in the prior year period due to the impact of fixed costs on a net sales base that was about half of the prior year. 
A few additional balance sheet items. Retail inventories were $2.2 billion at cost, a modest increase versus year-end as we took actions early in the quarter to cancel or reduce product purchase orders. 
Moving to Capex. Our capital expenditures were $42 million, with approximately 55% of the expense related to technology projects, including inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to meet the changing customer needs during this period. In regard to our capital allocation strategies, as a reminder, we have suspended our share repurchase and our quarterly dividend programs as part of our COVID response. The company remains committed to a capital return program over the mid to long term, and wel reevaluate when appropriate. 
Due to the continued uncertainty related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic we're not providing financial guidance for 2020. The situation is still evolving and remains volatile. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely in relation to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we're well positioned to manage through these uncertain times. 
Before closing, I want to reiterate some of what Mark stated earlier. First, we continue to have a strong focus on liquidity management, and we'll continue to drive actions to improve cash flow generation. 
Second, we're pursuing deliberate actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation. This will help address gross margin impressions related to the substantial shift of sales to digital channels. And as part of our store network optimization project, we plan to close approximately 200 stores over the next 2 years, representing about 21% of our total Bed Bath & Beyond stores. And we'll continue to focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluded related onetime costs. 
Third,is that we're making further investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.

I'm happy to participate in my first earnings call with Bed Bath & Beyond. I joined the company a little less than 2 months ago, and like my colleagues, I have come up to speed rather quickly under these most unusual of circumstances. Mark's vision for the future was the major attraction for me to join Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'm excited to be part of the broader team that will together transform this great brand. 
Today, I'll be speaking about 3 topics: first, a few comments about how our operations pivoted in the face of the COVID pandemic and store closures and powered the growth of our digital channels. Second, I will provide a few more details about our store network optimization project that was mentioned earlier. And third, an update on the end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain. 
As the COVID pandemic took hold in late March and forced the temporary closure of the majority of our stores, we rapidly evolved our operations to meet the changing needs of customers. As our stores closed, people across the country and beyond needed us more than ever to deliver essential products to their homes. To support the increased demand across our digital channels, we rapidly converted about 25% of our stores across the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers, which almost doubled our digital fulfillment capacity during the quarter. This allowed us to leverage the vast inventory resources within our stores with signed web orders locally and deliver quickly and enabled us to ship online orders in 2 days or less on average or make orders available for pickup in less than 2 hours. Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our teams, we accelerated the launch of BOPUS and contactless curbside pickup services in mid-April starting with buybuy BABY and Harmon stores that remained open and expanding to Bed Bath & Beyond and Cost Plus World Market stores that remain closed to the public. By the end of the quarter, these offerings had expanded to nearly 60% of our total stores. Customer response has increasingly been favorable, which shows how important the strategic investment in BOPUS and curbside pickup is to our business and to our customers. As our stores reopen, we are expanding the services to these locations, and we'll continue to optimize our omni fulfillment capabilities. 
In this COVID moment, we believe we can take this opportunity to not just simply close stores but to pivot and reshape and truly optimize our store footprint. We continue to believe that our physical store channel is an asset for us as we transform into a digital-first company, especially with our new omni fulfillment capabilities in BOPUS and curbside. As our initial work gets under way, we are building off the network optimization project that was completed by the company last year. Our approach includes a much deeper analysis of both individual store and market data. 
Recent geo analytical modeling shows that our Bed Bath & Beyond banner has lagged the market in store and digital sales growth. More specifically, we believe that the current physical footprint of our stores only addresses about 80% to 85% of the market opportunity and does not fully align to local market sales demand. Our immediate goal is to rightsize our store network in such a way that reduces redundant stores and supports a digital-first platform with the appropriate number of stores in the right locations to serve customer demand and accelerate growth. We will both lean into store closures and leverage the significant number of lease expirations coming due over the next several years to restructure our Bed Bath & Beyond portfolio, while in parallel, look at our other retail banners, drive cost productivity and accelerate improvements designed to help stabilize the business and deliver long-term profitable results. 
As previously said, we plan to move forward with about 200 store closures across the country over the next 2 years. While we expect the closures to unfavorably impact our top line, there is significant EBITDA upside. As we restructure the real estate portfolio, we will drive cost productivity and continuous improvement efforts to enable investments in operational capabilities to sustain business results. In the future, we will also test new store format economics and locations with the goal to strategically grow market share profitably. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain or E2E for short, which is a multiyear initiative intended to deliver a new supply chain and technology infrastructure to enhance fulfillment, drive cost savings, improve the customer experience and support the acceleration of omnichannel enhancement. 
The redesign road map touches all aspects of our business, including our product assortment, vendors, fulfillment centers and stores' all-in support of our customers' experience and cost efficiency. The program is expected to reduce our working capital requirements, significantly expand our direct sourcing and importing capabilities and further optimize our network routing. The redesign will facilitate growth in owned brands, improvements in lead time for store ordering and support enhanced omnichannel capabilities to drive digital growth. As part of the program, we plan to realign our network of pool points that replenish our store inventory, which will optimize our in-stock numbers and reduce store inventory requirements. We also plan to drastically reduce by the millions the number of annual vendor purchase orders we create, which our vendors will love. It will also drive greater efficiencies within our accounts payable area. And we plan to further optimize our fulfillment network routing to increase 1-day deliveries from our DCs and store locations. Overall, the E2E redesign is targeted to deliver significant savings over the next 3 years, a reduction in inventory and faster lead times. Through this initiative, we expect to deliver significant future cost savings while driving greater efficiencies across the supply chain. 
Technology will support the bulk of the redesign work and our teams are creating a more modern technology stack and efficient operating model to serve the company's transformation efforts. We are currently planning for the migration of our data and computing to the cloud, which will expedite and enhance our technology capabilities. We look forward to sharing more on this and the progress of all of these operational initiatives in the future. 
I will close with a brief update on the performance of our buybuy BABY banner during the quarter. On a directional basis, our U.S. and Canadian buybuy BABY business made up approximately 20% of our company's total net sales in the first quarter compared to about 10% last year. We remain very pleased with the business and how our teams excelled in creating a positive customer experience and providing the essential items they need to care for their families. Early on, buybuy BABY was deemed an essential retailer, and roughly 97% of our U.S. stores remained open during the pandemic. The spirit our people have shown to fight for our customers and our company has been just tremendous, ensuring we were in the stock on the most essential items like diapers, wipes, formula and baby food, goes to the heart of our commitment to our customers. A key highlight of our performance was when our BABY store led the company's pilot and standup of BOPUS and curbside pickup boosting online sales of toddler food, safety equipment, playroom items and sleepwear. Even with stores open, buybuy BABY's digital business grew almost as exponentially as a total company's digital sales in the quarter. 
In response to the rapidly changing customer demands, buybuy BABY quickly shifted its marketing approach to support growing online demand through increased digital marketing and adjusted content to reflect customer needs. For example, we enhanced our baby registry program to support expecting parents during these challenging times, including a new phone consultation service, enabling customers to ask questions to an expert baby registry adviser. We also launched Design Squad, an innovative one-stop shop for nursery design services and inspiration in partnership with our sister brand, Decorist. With a mission to provide parents everything they need to confidently prepare for their baby, we are reminded during these difficult times how important our role in their journey can and should be.

It certainly has been an exciting time to join Bed Bath & Beyond. Since arriving in March, I've learned so much in a really short amount of time. And I have to say I'm incredibly encouraged by how quickly our teams have responded in meeting the needs of our customers during this challenging time. The opportunity to make it easy for our customers to feel at home has never been greater. 
Today, let me start with some highlights of the quarter from a commercial perspective, and then I'll provide an update on our transformation progress within the merchandising area. 
As the impact of temporary store closures became apparent in March, we became incredibly agile and pivoted our merchandising and marketing approach, starting with expense control. We quickly canceled product purchase orders and modified future purchases to reduce merchandising inventory exposure and manage costs. We converted doors into regional fulfillment centers and redirected products from closed doors to these fulfillment stores as well as to our web warehouses to support increased digital demand. And we partnered with vendors to increase supply of and expedite high demand products as customer needs were changing as well as to optimize working capital. We also adjusted our marketing plan by minimizing or canceling print programs, brand campaigns and events, and we're focused on driving in-store only traffic. We adapted our marketing communications to better engage our customers online and stay relevant. 
Turning our attention to our digital business. We shifted our collective efforts to capitalize on the strong online demand as customers shells are in place. We created daily working teams focused on inventory flow and built new reporting to keep top items in stock. We increased our digital marketing spend to drive traffic to our websites, including increased investments in search, paid social and affiliate marketing to reach new customers online. We also refreshed our website with a more modern book, deal and voice, aligned to customer insights as well as with our new branding. Finally, we incorporated key learnings about customer behavior through detailed site metrics from partners like Pinterest to optimize merchandising and messaging. 
During the first quarter, we had greater than 200 million visits across our digital properties, which is more than a 35% increase over the prior year period. We also had in excess of 500,000 downloads of our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app across Apple and Google Play stores, which contributed to strong revenue demand from our mobile channel, which is up 134% compared to last year. And as Mark mentioned earlier, new customer acquisition through our digital channels was also strong, with nearly 40% of our online orders placed by customers new to ordering online, including over 10% that were completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond. Third-party data show that overall, Bed Bath & Beyond saw stronger online engagement rates than our peers during the quarter, including higher conversion derived from first-time purchasers. These are important insights for us to leverage as we further analyze our customer behavior trends to develop more advanced engagement tactics. These efforts in digital marketing, merchandising and agile fulfillment, along with the rollout expansion of BOPUS and curbside pick up services, help support explosive growth across our digital channels in the first quarter. 
As John described earlier, customer adoption of our BOPUS and curbside pickup services is extremely exciting, and our online customer ratings for these omnichannel services are high. We have created a great new opportunity to make it even easier for our customers to shop with us in new and safe ways. We have already enhanced the service with a new mobile app experience launched last month that allows customers to place BOPUS orders, checking in the store and receive curbside orders from their cars, all from their phone. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond stores are now offering Apple Pay to simplify the transaction process. 
From a product perspective, we saw product category trends in our own online business during the first quarter that were similar to broader market trends. For Bed Bath & Beyond, kitchen and food prep was the top-performing category online across each of the 3 months, including sales of kitchen electrics, which grew more than 117% as customers prepared [indiscernible] with their home. Sales of water filtration systems spiked in March and April, coinciding with the broader market trends of stockpiling on the essentials. Cleaning and home care was another strong product category throughout the first quarter, with online sales of vacuums up 129%, significantly outperforming compared to last year. The baby and toddler categories performed well online throughout the quarter, peaking in April due to strong overall demand for baby essentials and our acceleration of BOPUS and curbside pickup. 
In May, as customer behavior turned more inwards to provide comfort and enjoyment in the home, we saw strength in our bedding category beginning to grow driven by basic sheets, pillars and comforters. As we commenced store reopenings in late May and early June, we have seen the excitement in our customers looking to shop our total store across the board again. Kitchen electric select mixers continued the surge in sales, [ up ] 75% as customers enjoy cooking for their families who were gathered at home. We are also seeing a surge in outdoor living categories as customers invest in their home spaces and migrate from the inside to the outside of the home in the summer months. At a time when our homes becomes the center of our lives, we are very excited about the work that we're doing on the merchandising team in support of our new customer gaining purpose, make it easy to deal at home. 
We have developed a robust plan under the strategic framework of our 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people to rebuild our merchandising authority in the home space to stabilize the business and optimize for growth. Simply put, product is at the heart of what we do. Our goal is to create a differentiated and curated assortment that appeals to a broader array of customers from Gen Z to boomers, inspiring them to shop with us and make it easier to find what they need. Some of our initiatives underway include curating a new customer-driven assortment starting in key Bed Bath & Kitchen categories, including which products we should carry, which products we should add and which we should eliminate; developing and expanding our own brand portfolio; and to enhance our differentiation in the market. Next year in fiscal 2021, we plan to launch a number of exciting owned brands across mobile categories and aim to create preference through our quality brands and products. 
Negotiating improved costs and terms from our suppliers so we can increase our competitiveness in the marketplace during higher levels of in-stocks and inventory turns, while placing the right amount of product in the right stores through improvements in forecasting and centralized inventory replenish [indiscernible] logic; and establishing a vision for a new and improved omni-always customer experience, both in stores and on our digital sites. 
Additionally, price is a key driver of our ability to gain customer trips and frequency as well as long-term loyalty. The goal of this pillar is for Bed Bath & Beyond to be known as a specialty [indiscernible] retailer by offering clear and compelling values. Key areas of focus include: ensuring we have a competitive everyday pricing by leveraging our new dynamic online pricing engines and testing localized pricing for margin opportunity; building new end-to-end promotional tools and processes as well as optimizing our promotional spending and therefore, profitability; recurating our assortment to ensure we have the right price points and true value representation to better compete with mass market retailers; and evolving and modernizing our loyalty programs to better engage and retain more of our valuable customers. 
Lastly, we have launched an integrated planning process for our stores in our digital platform that will tie the product and price pillars together with place and promise, creating a consistent, compelling omnichannel experience for our customers in line with our strategic intact. We are excited about this new way to create a stronger merchandising and marketing plan and look forward to sharing our progress for a review. 
So while we're busy transforming for the future, we remain very focused on our store reopening plans and capitalizing on the momentum we have in our digital business. As an example, we have overhauled and elevated our Back to College program this year, which brings to life greater ease in affordability. With 4 value-oriented and affordable options, combined with the ease and convenience of our Signature College Bridge Street, pack and hold services, we can help them make often stressful college transition experiences that much easier. Overall, we are very encouraged about the progress being made to rebuild our authority within the home space with our customers. 
While we are in the early stages of this transformational work in merchandising, we are confident that our initiatives, such as refining and elevator assortment through a customer-centric lens, strengthening a better communicating value, modernizing our online store experiences with the new omnichannel [indiscernible] the right strategies. Our teams are embracing this change and leading into the new strategic direction with excitement.

As a new management team, we're spending a lot of time talking about this and evaluating it and formalizing our strategy so we can evolve it. Coupon, as you well know, is a big part of our mix today. But we're doing work on baseline pricing, like we launched dynamic pricing late last year. I think you've seen some more competitive price gaps to market over the last 6 months, which is something we wanted to effect. And we're continuing to evaluate more categories that we would look to put into dynamic pricing. But overall, pricing and promo is something we're, again, we're spending a lot of time on. And it's come to play in a few different ways. One, we're establishing category roles where we want to better guide our pricing strategies. So we are more focused on where we want to make price investments; two, we're activating thorough line reviews where we can affect pricing in conjunction with supplier discussions. We're using owned brands, and we will be more proactively in the future to address opening price points and good price points. And then we're also looking at new promotional tools to optimize promotions so that we can make sure when we do invest in promotions, that promotional spend is very effective and efficient. So -- and then lastly, I would say, over the long term, right, we are studying new ways to, again, evolve our loyalty programs.

And the program that John is leading is going to be focused on value creation. And as we've said, there may be some lost revenue, but certainly a pickup on profitability.

Mark, I appreciate you made the apples to oranges. This is a tricky moment in time, and I do think this moment suggests that maybe more can be retained digitally than ever before.

So I'm not going to get specific. But look, I mean, yes, it's in the realm. I think you've got -- we're looking at 2019 numbers. And clearly, 2020 is going to be a different ballgame in the end as the play. What we see is a slightly different issue to a lot of our competitors because we've been able to establish market density overlap, and therefore, duplication of the market. So we've got maybe 2 stores addressing 1 market that we could actually collapse higher level sales into. We've done the algorithmic math on this very, very carefully. We will see some sales degradation. We'll see some move into digital. We'll see some transfer. But the net-net of what we will achieve will be a really strong positive to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA, and then we can set about filling in some of the market-based gaps that we see maybe with a different format store or repositioning some of our fleet to really address the total market buys and scope. So it's a reframe and then reshape. But at the heart of it is the net-net benefit to EBITDA along the way. Again, we'll map out that in a sequential by-year impact.

But what I would say to you is that we actively agreed to pivot heavily into the Back to College moment as our first major change point. This was in the pre-COVID days. And we're very pleased we did, and we really monitor whether we should proceed and how we should proceed. And we've launched back to college early. It sets up in stores over the full month of July and a little bit into August while we've been active in digital for several weeks. We are very pleased with the double-digit gains we've seen both in-store and online. And the result of both engagement conversion sales, AUR, it's off and running. Now it did break late as per these changes. But we, several months ago, were correlating, as John mentioned, with companies like Pinterest, and we established that people who are pinning Back to College idea is very early and it's still very relevant in the consumer line set. We've lent in here, we have sharper price value. We have clear store and digital setups that's unique and aligned. We really have a very comprehensive program. It's off and running, and it's only -- it's not early onset. So we see that prevailing through the rest of the quarter.

Look, I think it's fair to say that the coupon is absolutely part of our DNA, and we want to use it more strategically and more surgically going forward. During the COVID period, we didn't lean into it as much. We actually normally have a lower rate of redemption of coupon on the digital business rather than a store-based business and when stores closed. It was a natural outcome. But as we've opened up, as Joe mentioned, we've pulled back on coupon, we pulled back on promotions, and we're seeing very good business as a result. It will not disappear. It's part of who we are. We're just going to be more strategic in the management of it. As we look at our price pillar and our price pillar, we'll be looking at the intersection between price, value, coupon and loyalty and unpacking that more with Cindy and Joe at the helm.

Good afternoon, everyone. As Janet said, we are speaking with you tonight from a remote location. I'd like to welcome you all to our call.
I'm happy to be here and excited for you to hear from some of our new leadership team as Janet described. Our presentation agenda for today includes an update on the strategic focus of the business, including our near-term actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our approach to store reopenings. Next, Gustavo will review our first quarter financial results. Then John will give us an update on the strategic focus of our operations, and Joe will do the same from a commercial perspective. We will then take questions.
The first half of 2020 has been extraordinary by any measure. No one could have anticipated the scale of the impact from this pandemic on this global economy and our own North American business, let alone the massive amount of decisions we would have to make to keep our people, customers and communities safe. I'm very proud of how our teams came together to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action. These decisions have not been easy, and we are aware of their consequences, especially for those of our associates impacted by the furlough, but I believe our response was the right one for the short-, medium- and long-term health of our people and our business.
Throughout the quarter, we remained hyper-focused on ensuring liquidity and optimizing costs, including actions to improve cash flow generation. We swiftly implemented various actions to maintain our financial flexibility including a tight control on operating expenses, managing our inventory, postponing some capital investments and suspending our capital allocation plans for share repurchase, debt reduction and quarterly dividends. We succeeded in controlling our monthly cash burn and ended the quarter in a strong cash investment position of $1.2 billion. Last month, after the quarter close, we further strengthened our liquidity with a new 3-year $850 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We are confident about our financial position and their ability to manage through these uncertain times.
While we have been managing through this difficult environment, we have not lost focus on our strategic imperative to rebuild our authority in the home space. We continue to make strong progress and even accelerated several elements of our transformation assets. Importantly, we onboarded 5 new senior leaders during the quarter, which was no small feat: Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; John Hartmann, Chief Operating Officer and President of buybuy BABY; Rafeh Masood, Chief Digital Officer; Arlene Hong, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Sectary; and Cindy Davis, our new Chief Brand Officer and President of Decorist. These 5 joined Joe Hartsig, our Chief Merchandising Officer and President of Harmon Stores, who joined in March; and Gregg Melnick, Chief Stores Officer, who was appointed to his new role in May and previously served as our interim Chief Digital Officer. I spent many months, supported by the Board, meeting candidates who have the right skills, experience and character to take our business to the next level. Our diverse team of highly experienced retail experts is complete. I'm delighted to finally have them all onboard to accelerate the pace of transformation.
Now from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, we've prioritized the health and safety of our team, customers and communities. We closed the vast majority of our retail banner stores on March 23 across the U.S. and Canada, excluding most buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores. As a result, nearly 90% of our locations remain closed during the majority of the quarter, leading to a 49% decline in net sales. This was a critical moment, and we needed to act quickly. It was an important opportunity for us to pivot to a new model and support changing customer preferences and our omni-always approach. Now with the vast majority of our stores closed, we realigned our network and converted 25% of our total store fleet into regional fulfillment centers, nearly doubling our fulfillment capacity to handle the dramatic shift in demand to our own digital channels and unlock store inventory.
Building on our fulfillment capabilities, we accelerated the pre-planned rollout of our Buy Online Pick up In Store or BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services offered in April, which is one of the key highlights of the quarter, especially for our buybuy BABY banner. As John will discuss in a few minutes, this was a game changer for us as it allowed us to restart operations and serve customers at locations that were still closed to the public.
By the time we ended the quarter in late May, we were offering BOPIS and Curbside Pickup at nearly 60% of our store locations. These new capabilities powered digital sales growth of more than 100% during the month of April and May. Net sales from our digital channels grew 82% in the first quarter and therefore, represented nearly 2/3 of total net sales.
Digital growth was also favorably impacted by the way we pivoted our merchandising and marketing plans and how we engage with our customers, including more frequent updates through our website to stay current and relevant. Joe will talk more about this in a few minutes, but a key highlight for us was the strong growth we saw in new customer acquisition through our digital channels. Nearly 40% of our online orders were placed by customers who are new to ordering online with us, and over 10% of them were also completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond. In late May, we began taking measured steps to reopen stores to the public, including the launch of our store safety plan to help ensure customers can shop in our stores confidently. During the past month, the pace of store reopenings has accelerated in line with changing local and state regulations, market data and the wider retail landscape.
Our strong financial flexibility allowed us to implement a market-by-market approach, while we invest in rebuilding our business and introducing new services for our customers. I want to thank our dedicated teams for helping us resume operations safely and welcoming back our loyal customers. We are proud of our teams and how quickly they adapted and took decisive actions to keep our people safe and deliver for our customers.
As of today, nearly all our stores have reopened to the public, and we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We're seeing good results across our reopened stores, and it's clear from the feedback we're hearing, the customers are delighted to be able to again shop in our stores and are taking advantage of the new BOPIS and curbside services. At the same time, we continue to see gradual recovery with the sales trends across our digital channels and growth, consistently more than 80% during the month of June. It is still early in the reopening process and the virus and its impact are still unpredictable, but we're encouraged by our customer support and response so far.
This COVID moment has provided many learnings that we are capitalizing on as we continue to track against our strategic objectives. As previously stated, we have grounded our strategic framework in 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people. You'll hear more about the product, price and place pillars today from John and Joe.  With these 5 pillars as our guide, we've embraced a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company.
To start, we redefined our purpose to make it easy to feel at home. This is a defining role of our business place for our customers, the North Star that guides all our actions. To achieve this purpose, our mission is to reestablish our authority and be the preferred home destination driven by teams consistently delivering balanced, durable growth. We believe this mission is more relevant today than ever when home is everything and being safe at home with family is essential. Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home.
In addition to the pillar strategies, we're also focused on investing and improving core proficiencies, the plumbing of a house that is essential to rebuilding the foundations of our business. This COVID moment also represents an opportunity for us to drive strong actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program. We have accelerated the further alignment of our cost structure with our near-term performance related to the pandemic. These include, among other things, our efforts to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation to address current gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales from stores to digital channels. Furthermore, we plan to close approximately 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores over the next 2 years under our store network optimization project and focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluding related onetime costs. We're also making additional investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.
As we previously outlined, we are committed to an ongoing review of our noncore business concepts. As of now, we have not factored any future proceeds from potential asset sales, including the sale of personalizationmall.com into our internal financial model. We plan to share the details around these actions and other short-term and longer-term goals and objectives during an Investor Day event expected to be held mid- to late October of this year. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we don't know if we will host the meeting in person or virtually, but our Investor Relations team will share more detailed information later this summer.
I will now turn the call over to Gustavo to review our first quarter results in detail. Gustavo?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I look forward to continue interactions with our analysts and investor community over the weeks and months to come. I've been on the job around 2 months now, which in pandemic time feels more like 2 years. I have been delighted to join Bed Bath & Beyond's team and look forward to help strengthen a sustainable business model for our company. We have an iconic brand, so I was attracted by the challenge and the opportunity of transforming the company to restore relevance in the minds and homes of customers.
Since I joined in May, our team has been intensively focused on ensuring liquidity and driving cost interventions as we manage our operations during the COVID crisis. This was achieved as we pivoted the company to a predominantly digital business while the majority of our stores were temporarily closed.
Let me provide some highlights on our fiscal first quarter. First, it's important to note that our quarter spanned the 3 most critical months to date of the COVID-19 pandemic: March, April and May. In response to this situation, our company acted quickly, prioritized interventions to maintain liquidity and took actions to control cash burn. Keep in mind that by the time we announced the temporary closure of stores on March 23, we had already paid some monthly expenses such as payroll, rent and other operational costs. So cash management strategies were into effect in conjunction with the store closure announcement in late March. Specifically, we furloughed the majority of our store associates and a portion of corporate associates. We started renegotiating with our vendors for extended payment terms and savings related to goods, services and rent. We proactively managed inventory and canceled purchase orders. And we immediately reduced discretionary spending in areas such as business travel, advertising and expenses associated with the maintenance of stores as well as deferred approximately $150 million in planned capital expenditures. As a result, we successfully lower our monthly cash burn and recorded a strong cash and investment balance of $1.2 billion by end May. And in June, we'll bolster our liquidity with a new $850 million asset-based lending facility, which provides substantial additional liquidity if needed.
Our net sales were impacted by having the vast majorities of our stores closed during most of the quarter. We operated mainly as a digital business during these months. With this, our gross margin was impacted by channel and product mix resulting from the substantial shift of sales to our digital channels.
Let's now look at our monthly cash burn. We entered the quarter in a very strong cash position coming off a year-end balance of $1.4 billion in cash and investments. In March, we elected to draw down the available $236 million from our unsecured revolving credit facility, which enhanced our cash position. As I said earlier, we have significant cash outflow during the first month. As we move into April, we implemented cash management strategies and carefully managed our inflows and outflows to reduce our cash burn. As we move into May, we were cash neutral, leaving us with a quarter-end balance of $1.2 billion in cash and investments.  If we consider the available liquidity under the new ABL facility that we entered into after the quarter closed, we have a total liquidity of more than $1.8 billion in available funds. This is great insurance and provides further financial flexibility as we implement our store reopening plans and focus on driving important actions under the company's strategic transformation plan.
Now I'll turn to the operational results of the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $2.44 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $2.91 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.48 per diluted share for special items mostly related to noncash impairments of certain store level assets and trade names. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter net loss per diluted share was $1.96. Consistent with our prior disclosures, the remainder of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis to better represent year-on-year performance of the business.
Net sales in the quarter were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 49% from the first quarter of last year primarily due to the temporary store closures. On a directional basis, net sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 82%, while net sales from our stores declined about 77%. We experienced a strong digital growth each month of the quarter starting in March with net sales from our digital channels up 17% as compared to March 2019. Then during April and May, we experienced explosive growth across our digital channels with net sales up more than 100% each month compared to these same 2 months in 2019. These strong results were supported by rollout and subsequent expansion of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup service offerings not only for Bed Bath & Beyond but also across our buybuy BABY, Harmon and Cost Plus World Market stores.
In June, after quarter end, we initiated our phased approach to store reopening as Mark discussed earlier. As of today, nearly all of our stores are open, and while it is still early days, we're pleased with the customer response. For the month of June, overall net sales decreased only 7%. During this same period, net sales from our digital channels remained strong with year-over-year growth in excess of 80%, while net sales from store declined approximately 25%, reflecting the gradual reopening during the course of the month.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin was 26.7% of net sales as compared to 34.5% last year. This 780 basis point decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact on channel and product mix in connection with the substantial shift in sales to digital channels. For some context, net sales from our digital channels represented nearly 2/3 of our total quarterly sales compared to penetration of nearly 1/5 in the prior year period. The incremental direct-to-customer shipping expense represented the bulk of the channel mix impact. In addition, higher sales of lower-margin COVID-essential items contributed to pressure in product mix.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter declined 15% or $123 million compared to the prior year. This decline reflects the impact from actions taken in response to COVID-19, including the associated furlough, lower discretionary spending and benefits from the CARES Act credits and cost reduction interventions that were initiated at the end of fiscal 2019 such as the corporate restructuring program. As a percentage of net sales, first quarter SG&A significantly increased to 55.3% from 32.9% of net sales in the prior year period due to the impact of fixed costs on a net sales base that was about half of the prior year.
A few additional balance sheet items. Retail inventories were $2.2 billion at cost, a modest increase versus year-end as we took actions early in the quarter to cancel or reduce product purchase orders.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures were $42 million with approximately 55% of the expense related to technology projects, including inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to meet the changing customer needs during this period. In regard to our capital allocation strategies, as a reminder, we have suspended our share repurchase and our quarterly dividend programs as part of our COVID response. The company remains committed to a capital return program over the mid to long term, and we'll reevaluate when appropriate.
Due to the continued uncertainty related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're not providing financial guidance for 2020. The situation is still evolving and remains volatile. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely in relation to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we're well positioned to manage through these uncertain times.
Before closing, I want to reiterate some of what Mark stated earlier. First, we continue to have a strong focus on liquidity management, and we'll continue to drive actions to improve cash flow generation.
Second, we're pursuing deliberate actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation. This will help address gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales to digital channels. And as part of our store network optimization project, we plan to close approximately 200 stores over the next 2 years, representing about 21% of our total Bed Bath & Beyond stores, and we'll continue to focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluded related onetime costs.
Third is that we're making further investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.

I'm happy to participate in my first earnings call with Bed Bath & Beyond. I joined the company a little less than 2 months ago, and like my colleagues, I have come up to speed rather quickly under these most unusual of circumstances. Mark's vision for the future was the major attraction for me to join Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'm excited to be part of the broader team that will together transform this great brand.
Today, I'll be speaking about 3 topics: first, a few comments about how our operations pivoted in the face of the COVID pandemic and store closures and powered the growth of our digital channels; second, I will provide a few more details about our store network optimization project that was mentioned earlier; and third, an update on the end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain.
As the COVID pandemic took hold in late March and forced the temporary closure of the majority of our stores, we rapidly evolved our operations to meet the changing needs of customers. As our stores closed, people across the country and beyond needed us more than ever to deliver essential products to their homes. To support the increased demand across our digital channels, we rapidly converted about 25% of our stores across the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers, which almost doubled our digital fulfillment capacity during the quarter. This allowed us to leverage the vast inventory resources within our stores with assigned web orders locally and deliver quickly and enabled us to ship online orders in 2 days or less on average or make orders available for pickup in less than 2 hours.
Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our teams, we accelerated the launch of BOPIS and contactless curbside pickup services in mid-April starting with buybuy BABY and Harmon Stores that remained open and expanding to Bed Bath & Beyond and Cost Plus World Market stores that remain closed to the public. By the end of the quarter, these offerings had expanded to nearly 60% of our total stores. Customer response has increasingly been favorable, which shows how important the strategic investment in BOPIS and Curbside Pickup is to our business and to our customers. As our stores reopen, we are expanding the services to these locations, and we'll continue to optimize our omni fulfillment capabilities.
In this COVID moment, we believe we can take this opportunity to not just simply close stores but to pivot and reshape and truly optimize our store footprint. We continue to believe that our physical store channel is an asset for us as we transform into a digital-first company, especially with our new omni fulfillment capabilities in BOPIS and curbside. As our initial work gets under way, we are building off the network optimization project that was completed by the company last year. Our approach includes a much deeper analysis of both individual store and market data.
Recent geo analytical modeling shows that our Bed Bath & Beyond banner has lagged the market in store and digital sales growth. More specifically, we believe that the current physical footprint of our stores only addresses about 80% to 85% of the market opportunity and does not fully align to the local market sales demand. Our immediate goal is to rightsize our store network in such a way that reduces redundant stores and supports a digital-first platform with the appropriate number of stores in the right locations to serve customer demand and accelerate growth. We will both lean into store closures and leverage the significant number of lease expirations coming due over the next several years to restructure our Bed Bath & Beyond store portfolio while, in parallel, look at our other retail banners, drive cost productivity and accelerate improvements designed to help stabilize the business and deliver long-term profitable results.
As previously said, we plan to move forward with about 200 store closures across the country over the next 2 years. While we expect the closures to unfavorably impact our top line, there is significant EBITDA upside. As we restructure the real estate portfolio, we will drive cost productivity and continuous improvement efforts to enable investments in operational capabilities to sustain business results. In the future, we will also test new store format economics and locations with the goal to strategically grow market share profitably.
Next, I'll provide an update on our end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain or e2e for short, which is a multiyear initiative intended to deliver a new supply chain and technology infrastructure to enhance fulfillment, drive cost savings, improve the customer experience and support the acceleration of omnichannel enhancements.
The redesign road map touches all aspects of our business, including our product assortment, vendors, fulfillment centers and stores all in support of our customers' experience and cost efficiency. The program is expected to reduce our working capital requirements, significantly expand our direct sourcing and importing capabilities, and further optimize our network routing. The redesign will facilitate growth in owned brands, improvements in lead time for store ordering and support enhanced omnichannel capabilities to drive digital growth. As part of the program, we plan to realign our network of pool points that replenish our store inventory, which will optimize our in-stock numbers and reduce store inventory requirements. We also plan to drastically reduce by the millions the number of annual vendor purchase orders we create, which our vendors will love. It will also drive greater efficiencies within our accounts payable area. And we plan to further optimize our fulfillment network routing to increase 1-day deliveries from our DCs and store locations. Overall, the e2e redesign is targeted to deliver significant savings over the next 3 years, a reduction in inventory and faster lead times. Through this initiative, we expect to deliver significant future cost savings while driving greater efficiencies across the supply chain.
Technology will support the bulk of the redesign work, and our teams are creating a more modern technology stack and efficient operating model to serve the company's transformation efforts. We are currently planning for the migration of our data and computing to the cloud, which will expedite and enhance our technology capabilities. We look forward to sharing more on this and the progress of all of these operational initiatives in the future.
I will close with a brief update on the performance of our buybuy BABY banner during the quarter. On a directional basis, our U.S. and Canadian buybuy BABY business made up approximately 20% of our company's total net sales in the first quarter compared to about 10% last year. We remain very pleased with the business and how our teams excelled in creating a positive customer experience and providing the essential items they need to care for their families.
Early on, buybuy BABY was deemed an essential retailer, and roughly 97% of our U.S. stores remained open during the pandemic. The spirit our people have shown to fight for our customers and our company has been just tremendous, ensuring we were in stock on the most essential items like diapers, wipes, formula and baby food goes to the heart of our commitment to our customers. A key highlight of our performance was when our BABY stores led the company's pilot and standup of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup boosting online sales of toddler food, safety equipment, playroom items and sleepwear. Even with stores open, buybuy BABY's digital business grew almost as exponentially as a total company's digital sales in the quarter.
In response to the rapidly changing customer demands, buybuy BABY quickly shifted its marketing approach to support growing online demand through increased digital marketing and adjusted content to reflect customer needs. For example, we enhanced our baby registry program to support expecting parents during these challenging times, including a new phone consultation service, enabling customers to ask questions to an expert baby registry adviser. We also launched Design Squad, an innovative one-stop shop for nursery design services and inspiration in partnership with our sister brand, Decorist. With a mission to provide parents everything they need to confidently prepare for their baby, we are reminded during these difficult times how important our role in their journey can and should be.

It certainly has been an exciting time to join Bed Bath & Beyond. Since arriving in March, I've learned so much in a really short amount of time, and I have to say I'm incredibly encouraged by how quickly our teams have responded in meeting the needs of our customers during this challenging time. The opportunity to make it easy for our customers to feel at home has never been greater.
Today, let me start with some highlights of the quarter from a commercial perspective, and then I'll provide an update on our transformation progress within the merchandising area.
As the impact of temporary store closures became apparent in March, we became incredibly agile and pivoted our merchandising and marketing approach starting with expense control. We quickly canceled product purchase orders and modified future purchases to reduce merchandising inventory exposure and managed costs. We converted doors into regional fulfillment centers and redirected products from closed doors to these fulfillment stores as well as to our web warehouses to support increased digital demand. And we partnered with vendors to increase supply of and expedite high demand products as customer needs were changing as well as to optimize working capital. We also adjusted our marketing plan by minimizing or canceling print programs, brand campaigns and events, and we're focused on driving in-store-only traffic. We adapted our marketing communications to better engage our customers online and stay relevant.
Turning our attention to our digital business. We shifted our collective efforts to capitalize on the strong online demand as customer [ shelves ] are in place. We created daily working teams focused on inventory flow and built new reporting to keep top items in stock. We increased our digital marketing spend to drive traffic to our websites, including increased investments in search, paid social and affiliate marketing to reach new customers online. We also refreshed our website with a more modern look, feel and voice aligned to customer insights as well as with our new branding. Finally, we incorporated key learnings about customer behavior through detailed site metrics from partners like Pinterest to optimize merchandising and messaging.
During the first quarter, we had greater than 200 million visits across our digital properties, which is more than a 35% increase over the prior year period. We also had in excess of 500,000 downloads of our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app across Apple and Google Play stores, which contributed to strong revenue demand from our mobile channel, which is up 134% compared to last year. And as Mark mentioned earlier, new customer acquisition through our digital channels was also strong with nearly 40% of our online orders placed by customers new to ordering online, including over 10% that were completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond.
Third-party data show that, overall, Bed Bath & Beyond saw stronger online engagement rates than our peers during the quarter, including higher conversion derived from first-time purchasers. These are important insights for us to leverage as we further analyze our customer behavior trends to develop more advanced engagement tactics. These efforts in digital marketing, merchandising and agile fulfillment, along with the rollout expansion of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services, helped support explosive growth across our digital channels in the first quarter.
As John described earlier, customer adoption of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services is extremely exciting, and our online customer ratings for these omnichannel services are high. We have created a great new opportunity to make it even easier for our customers to shop with us in new and safe ways. We have already enhanced this service with a new mobile app experience launched last month that allows customers to place BOPIS orders, check into the store and receive curbside orders from their cars all from their phone. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond stores are now offering Apple Pay to simplify the transaction process.
From a product perspective, we saw product category trends in our own online business during the first quarter that were similar to broader market trends. For Bed Bath & Beyond, kitchen and food prep was the top-performing category online across each of the 3 months, including sales of kitchen electrics, which grew more than 117% as customers prepared more food at home. Sales of water filtration systems spiked in March and April coinciding with the broader market trends of stockpiling on the essentials. Cleaning and home care was another strong product category throughout the first quarter with online sales of vacuums up 129%, significantly outperforming compared to last year. The baby and toddler categories performed well online throughout the quarter, peaking in April due to strong overall demand for baby essentials and our acceleration of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup.
In May, as customer behavior turned more inwards to providing comfort and enjoyment in the home, we saw strength in our bedding category beginning to grow driven by basic sheets, pillows and comforters. As we commenced store reopenings in late May and early June, we have seen the excitement in our customers looking to shop our total store across the board again. Kitchen electrics like mixers continued the surge in sales, up 75%, as customers enjoyed cooking for their families who were gathered at home. We are also seeing a surge in outdoor living categories as customers invest in their home spaces and migrate from the inside to the outside of the house in the summer months. At a time when our homes have become the center of our lives, we are very excited about the work that we're doing on the merchandising team in support of our new customer journey purpose: make it easy to feel at home.
We have developed a robust plan under the strategic framework of our 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people to rebuild our merchandising authority in the home space, to stabilize the business and optimize for growth. Simply put, product is at the heart of what we do. Our goal is to create a differentiated and curated assortment that appeals to a broader array of customers from Gen Z to boomers, inspiring them to shop with us and making it easier to find what they need. Some of our initiatives underway include curating a new customer-driven assortment starting in key bed, bath and kitchen categories, including which products we should carry, which products we should add and which we should eliminate; developing and expanding our owned brand portfolio; and to enhance our differentiation in the market. Next year in fiscal 2021, we plan to launch a number of exciting owned brands across multiple categories and aim to create preference through our quality brands and products; negotiating improved costs and terms from our suppliers so we can increase our competitiveness in the marketplace; ensuring higher levels of in-stocks and inventory turns while placing the right amount of product in the right stores through improvements in forecasting and centralized inventory replenishment logic; and establishing a vision for a new and improved omni-always customer experience both in stores and on our digital sites.
Additionally, price is a key driver of our ability to gain customer trips and frequency as well as long-term loyalty. The goal of this pillar is for Bed Bath & Beyond to be known as a specialty products retailer by offering clear and compelling values. Key areas of focus include: ensuring we have a competitive everyday pricing by leveraging our new dynamic online pricing engine and testing localized pricing for margin opportunity; building new end-to-end promotional tools and processes as well as optimizing our promotional spending and therefore, profitability; recurating our assortment to ensure we have the right price points and true value representation to better compete with mass market retailers; and evolving and modernizing our loyalty programs to better engage and retain more of our valuable customers.
Lastly, we have launched an integrated planning process for our stores and our digital platform that will tie the product and price pillars together with place and promise, creating a consistent, compelling omnichannel experience for our customers in line with our strategic intent. We are excited about this new way to create a stronger merchandising and marketing plan and look forward to sharing our progress further with you.
 
So while we're busy transforming for the future, we remain very focused on our store reopening plans and capitalizing on the momentum we have in our digital business. As an example, we have overhauled and elevated our back to college program this year, which brings to life greater ease and affordability. With 4 value-oriented and affordable options, combined with the ease and convenience of our signature College Registry and Pack & Hold services, we can help them make often stressful college transition experiences that much easier. Overall, we are very encouraged about the progress being made to rebuild our authority within the home space with our customers.
While we are in the early stages of this transformational work in merchandising, we are confident that our initiatives such as refining and elevating assortment through our customer-centric plans, strengthening a better communicating value and modernizing our online store experiences for the new omnichannel approach are the right strategies. Our teams are embracing this change and leaning into the new strategic direction with excitement.

We have maintained a strong liquidity position, including recent initiatives around cash preservation and the new ABL facility and believe we can continue to manage through these uncertain times.

There could be the checks from the government that are affecting the outcomes, but overall, we're seeing good patronage, good traffic and the trends staying stabilized. And what's nice against that, as those sales climb inside the stores, we're still seeing strength in our digital channel that is not changing, so a nice mix there and also a transfer to a greater merchandise mix rather than waiting into that early COVID period in essential.

Thanks, Curt. So again, as we outlined, we'll take the last bit first. The owned brand piece of it will really materialize into a Q1 onwards event that will really add value to our overall gross margin mix. We have been, as you said, very active in a number of buckets, and we didn't [indiscernible] but we are giving kind of an aggregate there, which is quite substantial on an annualized basis that will be taken in SG&A. So we are and have negotiated substantial savings in our COGS line. We're refashioning our assortment to lean into owned brands, which will have a supplementary benefit to margin. We are transforming our IT and general infrastructure costs with great savings. We are going to look at the store rationalization program, which will add dollars to the EBITDA line. And we were fortunate enough to -- in February 28, to already embark on a very strong $85 million cost reduction, which was fortuitous ahead of the COVID moment. So all these things collectively will represent another $250 million to $350 million, but we do look forward to kind of laying them more in buckets for you at the October investor community day.

So I think as Mark had mentioned, price is 1 of the 5 key pillars that we're focused on. So when you think about price and promo, that all comes together under value. Value is important to our customers, and it's something we've taking very seriously. As a new management team, we're spending a lot of time talking about this and evaluating it and formalizing our strategy so we can evolve it.
Coupon, as you well know, is a big part of our mix today, but we're doing work on baseline pricing, like we launched dynamic pricing late last year. I think you've seen some more competitive price gaps to market over the last 6 months, which is something we wanted to effect, and we'll continue to evaluate more categories that we would look to put into dynamic pricing. 
But overall, pricing is -- pricing and promo is something we're -- again, we're spending a lot of time on, and it's come into play in a few different ways. One, we're establishing category roles where we want to better guide our pricing strategies, so we are more focused on where we want to make price investments. Two, we're activating thorough line reviews where we can affect pricing in conjunction with supplier discussions. We're using owned brands, and we will be more proactively in the future to address opening price points and good price points. And then we're also looking at new promotional tools to optimize promotions so that we can make sure when we do invest in promotions, that promotional spend is very effective and efficient.

We're looking at this holistically as a change in our business model putting digital first, and therefore, it's not only about the SG&A within those four walls but what revenue P&L they generate. And the program that John is leading is going to be focused on value creation, and as he said, there may be some lost revenue but certainly a pickup on profitability.

I realize you're not putting a lot of math around it, but based on your answers to the prior question, it sounds like that you may be assuming a higher sales transfer rate. Mark, I appreciate you made the apples to oranges. This is a tricky moment in time, and I do think this moment suggests that maybe more can be retained digitally than ever before.

So I'm not going to get specific, but look, I mean, yes, it's in the realm. I think you've got -- we're looking at 2019 numbers, and clearly, 2020 is going to be a different ballgame in the end of the play. What we see is a slightly different issue to a lot of our competitors because we've been able to establish market density overlap and therefore, duplication of the market. So we've got maybe 2 stores addressing 1 market that we could actually collapse higher level sales into. We've done the algorithmic math on this very, very carefully. We will see some sales degradation. We'll see some move into digital. We'll see some transfer. But the net-net of what we will achieve will be a really strong positive to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA, and then we can set about filling in some of the market-based gaps that we see maybe with a different format store or repositioning some of our fleet to really address the total market buys and scope. So it's a reframe and then reshape, but at the heart of it is the net-net benefit to EBITDA along the way. Again, we'll map out that in a sequential by-year impact. Some of it will begin in Q4 of 2020, but the majority of it will be over the next 2 years.

This was in the pre-COVID days. And we're very pleased we did, and we really monitor whether we should proceed and how we should proceed. And we've launched back to college early. It sets up in stores over the full month of July and a little bit into August, but we've been active in digital for several weeks. We are very pleased with the double-digit gains we've seen both in-store and online, and the result of both engagement conversion, sales, AUR, it's off and running.
Now it did break late as per these changes, but we, several months ago, were correlating, as John mentioned, with companies like Pinterest, and we established that people were pinning back to college ideas very early and still very relevant in the consumer line set. We've lent in here we have sharper price value. We have clear store and digital setups that's unique and aligned. We really have a very comprehensive program. It's off and running, and it's only early onset. So we see that prevailing through the rest of the quarter.

And I just don't recall we've seen this level of promotions. So I guess my question is, first off, were increased promotions a factor at all in terms of the gross margin degradation in the first quarter. And then second off, is -- am I sort of reading into this -- too much into this? Or have you made any sort of change in terms of your promotional strategy?",Anthony Chukumba,412183080.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I'll take that. So promotions will continue to be part of our marketing mix and merchandising mix, but we learned a lot about promotions over the last, I would say, 8 months. I would say we are investing, as I mentioned, in tools to make sure when we do promotions, we get a stronger lift and the investment that we make. I would say, back in March, we dialed back the promotions pretty significantly because we didn't see them working. I think we'd called it out before, and we didn't have all the right processes and tools probably to understand the elasticity of lift that we need to drive an effective promotional strategy going forward. So we're making those changes and improvements, and we'll be selecting what we do. So I wouldn't read too much into what you're seeing on the website.

Look, I think it's fair to say that the coupon is absolutely part of our DNA, and we want to use it more strategically and more surgically going forward. During the COVID period, we didn't lean into it as much. We actually normally have a lower rate of redemption of coupon on the digital business rather than a store-based business, and when stores closed, it was a natural outcome. But as we've opened up, as Joe has mentioned, we've pulled back on coupon. We've pulled back on promotions, and we're seeing very good business as a result. It will not disappear. It's part of who we are. We're just going to be more strategic in the management of it. As we look at our price pillar and our promise pillar, we'll be looking at the intersection between price, value, coupon and loyalty and unpacking that more with Cindy and Joe at the helm.

Peter, this is Joe again. Some of the work started back in the fall of last year when we look at some of our destination categories and in bedding and bath. And we employed some work to look at how we would improve our COGS through different ways of sourcing. We've been pretty effective in that, but again, we're working through a lot of transition inventory. And I won't remark on the benefits yet. Maybe I'd let Mark or Gustavo opine on that. But I would say we're pleased with some of the work that's going on, and we are rolling into the next phase of that with a second and third set of categories.
So one of the things that's real promising for us is using data and external data and internal data much more effectively to do line reviews.

We are doing all of the above concurrently, started last year. They have different times of hitting the benefit to the bottom line, but they are ongoing. They're deep. They're rich, and we're really excited about that curation work. Joe stepped in, led that feverishly, and it's great work.

Good afternoon, everyone. As Janet said, we are speaking with you tonight from a remote location. I'd like to welcome you all to our call.
I'm happy to be here and excited for you to hear from some of our new leadership team as Janet described. Our presentation agenda for today includes an update on the strategic focus of the business, including our near-term actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our approach to store reopenings. Next, Gustavo will review our first quarter financial results. Then John will give us an update on the strategic focus of our operations, and Joe will do the same from a commercial perspective. We will then take questions.
The first half of 2020 has been extraordinary by any measure. No one could have anticipated the scale of the impact from this pandemic on this global economy and our own North American business, let alone the massive amount of decisions we would have to make to keep our people, customers and communities safe. I'm very proud of how our teams came together to assess the risks, understand the consequences and take decisive action. These decisions have not been easy, and we are aware of their consequences, especially for those of our associates impacted by the furlough, but I believe our response was the right one for the short-, medium- and long-term health of our people and our business.
Throughout the quarter, we remained hyper-focused on ensuring liquidity and optimizing costs, including actions to improve cash flow generation. We swiftly implemented various actions to maintain our financial flexibility including a tight control on operating expenses, managing our inventory, postponing some capital investments and suspending our capital allocation plans for share repurchase, debt reduction and quarterly dividends. We succeeded in controlling our monthly cash burn and ended the quarter in a strong cash investment position of $1.2 billion. Last month, after the quarter close, we further strengthened our liquidity with a new 3-year $850 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We are confident about our financial position and their ability to manage through these uncertain times.
While we have been managing through this difficult environment, we have not lost focus on our strategic imperative to rebuild our authority in the home space. We continue to make strong progress and even accelerated several elements of our transformation assets. Importantly, we onboarded 5 new senior leaders during the quarter, which was no small feat: Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; John Hartmann, Chief Operating Officer and President of buybuy BABY; Rafeh Masood, Chief Digital Officer; Arlene Hong, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Sectary; and Cindy Davis, our new Chief Brand Officer and President of Decorist. These 5 joined Joe Hartsig, our Chief Merchandising Officer and President of Harmon Stores, who joined in March; and Gregg Melnick, Chief Stores Officer, who was appointed to his new role in May and previously served as our interim Chief Digital Officer. I spent many months, supported by the Board, meeting candidates who have the right skills, experience and character to take our business to the next level. Our diverse team of highly experienced retail experts is complete. I'm delighted to finally have them all onboard to accelerate the pace of transformation.
Now from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, we've prioritized the health and safety of our team, customers and communities. We closed the vast majority of our retail banner stores on March 23 across the U.S. and Canada, excluding most buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values stores. As a result, nearly 90% of our locations remain closed during the majority of the quarter, leading to a 49% decline in net sales. This was a critical moment, and we needed to act quickly. It was an important opportunity for us to pivot to a new model and support changing customer preferences and our omni-always approach. Now with the vast majority of our stores closed, we realigned our network and converted 25% of our total store fleet into regional fulfillment centers, nearly doubling our fulfillment capacity to handle the dramatic shift in demand to our own digital channels and unlock store inventory.
Building on our fulfillment capabilities, we accelerated the pre-planned rollout of our Buy Online Pick up In Store or BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services offered in April, which is one of the key highlights of the quarter, especially for our buybuy BABY banner. As John will discuss in a few minutes, this was a game changer for us as it allowed us to restart operations and serve customers at locations that were still closed to the public.
By the time we ended the quarter in late May, we were offering BOPIS and Curbside Pickup at nearly 60% of our store locations. These new capabilities powered digital sales growth of more than 100% during the month of April and May. Net sales from our digital channels grew 82% in the first quarter and therefore, represented nearly 2/3 of total net sales.
Digital growth was also favorably impacted by the way we pivoted our merchandising and marketing plans and how we engage with our customers, including more frequent updates through our website to stay current and relevant. Joe will talk more about this in a few minutes, but a key highlight for us was the strong growth we saw in new customer acquisition through our digital channels. Nearly 40% of our online orders were placed by customers who are new to ordering online with us, and over 10% of them were also completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond. In late May, we began taking measured steps to reopen stores to the public, including the launch of our store safety plan to help ensure customers can shop in our stores confidently. During the past month, the pace of store reopenings has accelerated in line with changing local and state regulations, market data and the wider retail landscape.
Our strong financial flexibility allowed us to implement a market-by-market approach, while we invest in rebuilding our business and introducing new services for our customers. I want to thank our dedicated teams for helping us resume operations safely and welcoming back our loyal customers. We are proud of our teams and how quickly they adapted and took decisive actions to keep our people safe and deliver for our customers.
As of today, nearly all our stores have reopened to the public, and we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We're seeing good results across our reopened stores, and it's clear from the feedback we're hearing, the customers are delighted to be able to again shop in our stores and are taking advantage of the new BOPIS and curbside services. At the same time, we continue to see gradual recovery in weekly sales trends across our digital channels and growth, consistently more than 80% during the month of June. It is still early in the reopening process and the virus and its impact are still unpredictable, but we're encouraged by our customer support and response so far.
This COVID moment has provided many learnings that we are capitalizing on as we continue to track against our strategic objectives. As previously stated, we have grounded our strategic framework in 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people. You'll hear more about the product, price and place pillars today from John and Joe.  With these 5 pillars as our guide, we've embraced a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company.
To start, we redefined our purpose to make it easy to feel at home. This is a defining role of our business place for our customers, the North Star that guides all our actions. To achieve this purpose, our mission is to reestablish our authority and be the preferred home destination driven by teams consistently delivering balanced, durable growth. We believe this mission is more relevant today than ever when home is everything and being safe at home with family is essential. Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home.
In addition to the pillar strategies, we're also focused on investing and improving core proficiencies, the plumbing of a house that is essential to rebuilding the foundations of our business. This COVID moment also represents an opportunity for us to drive strong actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program. We have accelerated the further alignment of our cost structure with our near-term performance related to the pandemic. These include, among other things, our efforts to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation to address current gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales from stores to digital channels. Furthermore, we plan to close approximately 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores over the next 2 years under our store network optimization project and focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluding related onetime costs. We're also making additional investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.
As we previously outlined, we are committed to an ongoing review of our noncore business concepts. As of now, we have not factored any future proceeds from potential asset sales, including the sale of personalizationmall.com into our internal financial model. We plan to share the details around these actions and other short-term and longer-term goals and objectives during an Investor Day event expected to be held mid- to late October of this year. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we don't know if we will host the meeting in person or virtually, but our Investor Relations team will share more detailed information later this summer.
I will now turn the call over to Gustavo to review our first quarter results in detail. Gustavo?",Mark Tritton,642998325.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I look forward to continue interactions with our analysts and investor community over the weeks and months to come. I've been on the job around 2 months now, which in pandemic time feels more like 2 years. I have been delighted to join Bed Bath & Beyond's team and look forward to help strengthen a sustainable business model for our company. We have an iconic brand, so I was attracted by the challenge and the opportunity of transforming the company to restore relevance in the minds and homes of customers.
Since I joined in May, our team has been intensively focused on ensuring liquidity and driving cost interventions as we manage our operations during the COVID crisis. This was achieved as we pivoted the company to a predominantly digital business while the majority of our stores were temporarily closed.
Let me provide some highlights on our fiscal first quarter. First, it's important to note that our quarter spanned the 3 most critical months to date of the COVID-19 pandemic: March, April and May. In response to this situation, our company acted quickly, prioritized interventions to maintain liquidity and took actions to control cash burn. Keep in mind that by the time we announced the temporary closure of stores on March 23, we had already paid some monthly expenses such as payroll, rent and other operational costs. So cash management strategies were into effect in conjunction with the store closure announcement in late March. Specifically, we furloughed the majority of our store associates and a portion of corporate associates. We started renegotiating with our vendors for extended payment terms and savings related to goods, services and rent. We proactively managed inventory and canceled purchase orders. And we immediately reduced discretionary spending in areas such as business travel, advertising and expenses associated with the maintenance of stores as well as deferred approximately $150 million in planned capital expenditures. As a result, we successfully lower our monthly cash burn and recorded a strong cash and investment balance of $1.2 billion by end May. And in June, we'll bolster our liquidity with a new $850 million asset-based lending facility, which provides substantial additional liquidity if needed.
Our net sales were impacted by having the vast majorities of our stores closed during most of the quarter. We operated mainly as a digital business during these months. With this, our gross margin was impacted by channel and product mix resulting from the substantial shift of sales to our digital channels.
Let's now look at our monthly cash burn. We entered the quarter in a very strong cash position coming off a year-end balance of $1.4 billion in cash and investments. In March, we elected to draw down the available $236 million from our unsecured revolving credit facility, which enhanced our cash position. As I said earlier, we have significant cash outflow during the first month. As we move into April, we implemented cash management strategies and carefully managed our inflows and outflows to reduce our cash burn. As we move into May, we were cash neutral, leaving us with a quarter-end balance of $1.2 billion in cash and investments.  If we consider the available liquidity under the new ABL facility that we entered into after the quarter closed, we have a total liquidity of more than $1.8 billion in available funds. This is great insurance and provides further financial flexibility as we implement our store reopening plans and focus on driving important actions under the company's strategic transformation plan.
Now I'll turn to the operational results of the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $2.44 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $2.91 in the prior year period. Our reported net loss includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.48 per diluted share for special items mostly related to noncash impairments of certain store level assets and trade names. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter net loss per diluted share was $1.96. Consistent with our prior disclosures, the remainder of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis to better represent year-on-year performance of the business.
Net sales in the quarter were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 49% from the first quarter of last year primarily due to the temporary store closures. On a directional basis, net sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 82%, while net sales from our stores declined about 77%. We experienced a strong digital growth each month of the quarter starting in March with net sales from our digital channels up 17% as compared to March 2019. Then during April and May, we experienced explosive growth across our digital channels with net sales up more than 100% each month compared to these same 2 months in 2019. These strong results were supported by rollout and subsequent expansion of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup service offerings not only for Bed Bath & Beyond but also across our buybuy BABY, Harmon and Cost Plus World Market stores.
In June, after quarter end, we initiated our phased approach to store reopening as Mark discussed earlier. As of today, nearly all of our stores are open, and while it is still early days, we're pleased with the customer response. For the month of June, overall net sales decreased only 7%. During this same period, net sales from our digital channels remained strong with year-over-year growth in excess of 80%, while net sales from store declined approximately 25%, reflecting the gradual reopening during the course of the month.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin was 26.7% of net sales as compared to 34.5% last year. This 780 basis point decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact on channel and product mix in connection with the substantial shift in sales to digital channels. For some context, net sales from our digital channels represented nearly 2/3 of our total quarterly sales compared to penetration of nearly 1/5 in the prior year period. The incremental direct-to-customer shipping expense represented the bulk of the channel mix impact. In addition, higher sales of lower-margin COVID-essential items contributed to pressure in product mix.
Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter declined 15% or $123 million compared to the prior year. This decline reflects the impact from actions taken in response to COVID-19, including the associated furlough, lower discretionary spending and benefits from the CARES Act credits and cost reduction interventions that were initiated at the end of fiscal 2019 such as the corporate restructuring program. As a percentage of net sales, first quarter SG&A significantly increased to 55.3% from 32.9% of net sales in the prior year period due to the impact of fixed costs on a net sales base that was about half of the prior year.
A few additional balance sheet items. Retail inventories were $2.2 billion at cost, a modest increase versus year-end as we took actions early in the quarter to cancel or reduce product purchase orders.
Moving to CapEx. Our capital expenditures were $42 million with approximately 55% of the expense related to technology projects, including inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to meet the changing customer needs during this period. In regard to our capital allocation strategies, as a reminder, we have suspended our share repurchase and our quarterly dividend programs as part of our COVID response. The company remains committed to a capital return program over the mid to long term, and we'll reevaluate when appropriate.
Due to the continued uncertainty related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're not providing financial guidance for 2020. The situation is still evolving and remains volatile. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely in relation to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we're well positioned to manage through these uncertain times.
Before closing, I want to reiterate some of what Mark stated earlier. First, we continue to have a strong focus on liquidity management, and we'll continue to drive actions to improve cash flow generation.
Second, we're pursuing deliberate actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation. This will help address gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales to digital channels. And as part of our store network optimization project, we plan to close approximately 200 stores over the next 2 years, representing about 21% of our total Bed Bath & Beyond stores, and we'll continue to focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluded related onetime costs.
Third is that we're making further investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth.

I'm happy to participate in my first earnings call with Bed Bath & Beyond. I joined the company a little less than 2 months ago, and like my colleagues, I have come up to speed rather quickly under these most unusual of circumstances. Mark's vision for the future was the major attraction for me to join Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'm excited to be part of the broader team that will together transform this great brand.
Today, I'll be speaking about 3 topics: first, a few comments about how our operations pivoted in the face of the COVID pandemic and store closures and powered the growth of our digital channels; second, I will provide a few more details about our store network optimization project that was mentioned earlier; and third, an update on the end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain.
As the COVID pandemic took hold in late March and forced the temporary closure of the majority of our stores, we rapidly evolved our operations to meet the changing needs of customers. As our stores closed, people across the country and beyond needed us more than ever to deliver essential products to their homes. To support the increased demand across our digital channels, we rapidly converted about 25% of our stores across the U.S. and Canada into regional fulfillment centers, which almost doubled our digital fulfillment capacity during the quarter. This allowed us to leverage the vast inventory resources within our stores with assigned web orders locally and deliver quickly and enabled us to ship online orders in 2 days or less on average or make orders available for pickup in less than 2 hours.
Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our teams, we accelerated the launch of BOPIS and contactless curbside pickup services in mid-April starting with buybuy BABY and Harmon Stores that remained open and expanding to Bed Bath & Beyond and Cost Plus World Market stores that remain closed to the public. By the end of the quarter, these offerings had expanded to nearly 60% of our total stores. Customer response has increasingly been favorable, which shows how important the strategic investment in BOPIS and Curbside Pickup is to our business and to our customers. As our stores reopen, we are expanding the services to these locations, and we'll continue to optimize our omni fulfillment capabilities.
In this COVID moment, we believe we can take this opportunity to not just simply close stores but to pivot and reshape and truly optimize our store footprint. We continue to believe that our physical store channel is an asset for us as we transform into a digital-first company, especially with our new omni fulfillment capabilities in BOPIS and curbside. As our initial work gets under way, we are building off the network optimization project that was completed by the company last year. Our approach includes a much deeper analysis of both individual store and market data.
Recent geo analytical modeling shows that our Bed Bath & Beyond banner has lagged the market in store and digital sales growth. More specifically, we believe that the current physical footprint of our stores only addresses about 80% to 85% of the market opportunity and does not fully align to the local market sales demand. Our immediate goal is to rightsize our store network in such a way that reduces redundant stores and supports a digital-first platform with the appropriate number of stores in the right locations to serve customer demand and accelerate growth. We will both lean into store closures and leverage the significant number of lease expirations coming due over the next several years to restructure our Bed Bath & Beyond store portfolio while, in parallel, look at our other retail banners, drive cost productivity and accelerate improvements designed to help stabilize the business and deliver long-term profitable results.
As previously said, we plan to move forward with about 200 store closures across the country over the next 2 years. While we expect the closures to unfavorably impact our top line, there is significant EBITDA upside. As we restructure the real estate portfolio, we will drive cost productivity and continuous improvement efforts to enable investments in operational capabilities to sustain business results. In the future, we will also test new store format economics and locations with the goal to strategically grow market share profitably.
Next, I'll provide an update on our end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain or e2e for short, which is a multiyear initiative intended to deliver a new supply chain and technology infrastructure to enhance fulfillment, drive cost savings, improve the customer experience and support the acceleration of omnichannel enhancements.
The redesign road map touches all aspects of our business, including our product assortment, vendors, fulfillment centers and stores all in support of our customers' experience and cost efficiency. The program is expected to reduce our working capital requirements, significantly expand our direct sourcing and importing capabilities, and further optimize our network routing. The redesign will facilitate growth in owned brands, improvements in lead time for store ordering and support enhanced omnichannel capabilities to drive digital growth. As part of the program, we plan to realign our network of pool points that replenish our store inventory, which will optimize our in-stock numbers and reduce store inventory requirements. We also plan to drastically reduce by the millions the number of annual vendor purchase orders we create, which our vendors will love. It will also drive greater efficiencies within our accounts payable area. And we plan to further optimize our fulfillment network routing to increase 1-day deliveries from our DCs and store locations. Overall, the e2e redesign is targeted to deliver significant savings over the next 3 years, a reduction in inventory and faster lead times. Through this initiative, we expect to deliver significant future cost savings while driving greater efficiencies across the supply chain.
Technology will support the bulk of the redesign work, and our teams are creating a more modern technology stack and efficient operating model to serve the company's transformation efforts. We are currently planning for the migration of our data and computing to the cloud, which will expedite and enhance our technology capabilities. We look forward to sharing more on this and the progress of all of these operational initiatives in the future.
I will close with a brief update on the performance of our buybuy BABY banner during the quarter. On a directional basis, our U.S. and Canadian buybuy BABY business made up approximately 20% of our company's total net sales in the first quarter compared to about 10% last year. We remain very pleased with the business and how our teams excelled in creating a positive customer experience and providing the essential items they need to care for their families.
Early on, buybuy BABY was deemed an essential retailer, and roughly 97% of our U.S. stores remained open during the pandemic. The spirit our people have shown to fight for our customers and our company has been just tremendous, ensuring we were in stock on the most essential items like diapers, wipes, formula and baby food goes to the heart of our commitment to our customers. A key highlight of our performance was when our BABY stores led the company's pilot and standup of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup boosting online sales of toddler food, safety equipment, playroom items and sleepwear. Even with stores open, buybuy BABY's digital business grew almost as exponentially as a total company's digital sales in the quarter.
In response to the rapidly changing customer demands, buybuy BABY quickly shifted its marketing approach to support growing online demand through increased digital marketing and adjusted content to reflect customer needs. For example, we enhanced our baby registry program to support expecting parents during these challenging times, including a new phone consultation service, enabling customers to ask questions to an expert baby registry adviser. We also launched Design Squad, an innovative one-stop shop for nursery design services and inspiration in partnership with our sister brand, Decorist. With a mission to provide parents everything they need to confidently prepare for their baby, we are reminded during these difficult times how important our role in their journey can and should be.

It certainly has been an exciting time to join Bed Bath & Beyond. Since arriving in March, I've learned so much in a really short amount of time, and I have to say I'm incredibly encouraged by how quickly our teams have responded in meeting the needs of our customers during this challenging time. The opportunity to make it easy for our customers to feel at home has never been greater.
Today, let me start with some highlights of the quarter from a commercial perspective, and then I'll provide an update on our transformation progress within the merchandising area.
As the impact of temporary store closures became apparent in March, we became incredibly agile and pivoted our merchandising and marketing approach starting with expense control. We quickly canceled product purchase orders and modified future purchases to reduce merchandising inventory exposure and managed costs. We converted stores into regional fulfillment centers and redirected products from closed doors to these fulfillment stores as well as to our web warehouses to support increased digital demand. And we partnered with vendors to increase supply of and expedite high demand products as customer needs were changing as well as to optimize working capital. We also adjusted our marketing plan by minimizing or canceling print programs, brand campaigns and events, and we're focused on driving in-store-only traffic. We adapted our marketing communications to better engage our customers online and stay relevant.
Turning our attention to our digital business. We shifted our collective efforts to capitalize on the strong online demand as customers sheltered in place. We created daily working teams focused on inventory flow and built new reporting to keep top items in stock. We increased our digital marketing spend to drive traffic to our websites, including increased investments in search, paid social and affiliate marketing to reach new customers online. We also refreshed our website with a more modern look, feel and voice aligned to customer insights as well as with our new branding. Finally, we incorporated key learnings about customer behavior through detailed site metrics from partners like Pinterest to optimize merchandising and messaging.
During the first quarter, we had greater than 200 million visits across our digital properties, which is more than a 35% increase over the prior year period. We also had in excess of 500,000 downloads of our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app across Apple and Google Play stores, which contributed to strong revenue demand from our mobile channel, which is up 134% compared to last year. And as Mark mentioned earlier, new customer acquisition through our digital channels was also strong with nearly 40% of our online orders placed by customers new to ordering online, including over 10% that were completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond.
Third-party data show that, overall, Bed Bath & Beyond saw stronger online engagement rates than our peers during the quarter, including higher conversion derived from first-time purchasers. These are important insights for us to leverage as we further analyze our customer behavior trends to develop more advanced engagement tactics. These efforts in digital marketing, merchandising and agile fulfillment, along with the rollout expansion of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services, helped support explosive growth across our digital channels in the first quarter.
As John described earlier, customer adoption of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services is extremely exciting, and our online customer ratings for these omnichannel services are high. We have created a great new opportunity to make it even easier for our customers to shop with us in new and safe ways. We have already enhanced this service with a new mobile app experience launched last month that allows customers to place BOPIS orders, check into the store and receive curbside orders from their cars all from their phone. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond stores are now offering Apple Pay to simplify the transaction process.
From a product perspective, we saw product category trends in our own online business during the first quarter that were similar to broader market trends. For Bed Bath & Beyond, kitchen and food prep was the top-performing category online across each of the 3 months, including sales of kitchen electrics, which grew more than 117% as customers prepared more food at home. Sales of water filtration systems spiked in March and April coinciding with the broader market trends of stockpiling on the essentials. Cleaning and home care was another strong product category throughout the first quarter with online sales of vacuums up 129%, significantly outperforming compared to last year. The baby and toddler categories performed well online throughout the quarter, peaking in April due to strong overall demand for baby essentials and our acceleration of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup.
In May, as customer behavior turned more inwards to providing comfort and enjoyment in the home, we saw strength in our bedding category beginning to grow driven by basic sheets, pillows and comforters. As we commenced store reopenings in late May and early June, we have seen the excitement in our customers looking to shop our total store across the board again. Kitchen electrics like mixers continued the surge in sales, up 75%, as customers enjoyed cooking for their families who were gathered at home. We are also seeing a surge in outdoor living categories as customers invest in their home spaces and migrate from the inside to the outside of the house in the summer months. At a time when our homes have become the center of our lives, we are very excited about the work that we're doing on the merchandising team in support of our new customer journey purpose: make it easy to feel at home.
We have developed a robust plan under the strategic framework of our 5 key pillars: product, price, place, promise and people to rebuild our merchandising authority in the home space, to stabilize the business and optimize for growth. Simply put, product is at the heart of what we do. Our goal is to create a differentiated and curated assortment that appeals to a broader array of customers from Gen Z to boomers, inspiring them to shop with us and making it easier to find what they need. Some of our initiatives underway include curating a new customer-driven assortment starting in key bed, bath and kitchen categories, including which products we should carry, which products we should add and which we should eliminate; developing and expanding our owned brand portfolio; and to enhance our differentiation in the market. Next year in fiscal 2021, we plan to launch a number of exciting owned brands across multiple categories and aim to create preference through our quality brands and products; negotiating improved costs and terms from our suppliers so we can increase our competitiveness in the marketplace; ensuring higher levels of in-stocks and inventory turns while placing the right amount of product in the right stores through improvements in forecasting and centralized inventory replenishment logic; and establishing a vision for a new and improved omni-always customer experience both in stores and on our digital sites.
Additionally, price is a key driver of our ability to gain customer trips and frequency as well as long-term loyalty. The goal of this pillar is for Bed Bath & Beyond to be known as a specialty products retailer by offering clear and compelling values. Key areas of focus include: ensuring we have a competitive everyday pricing by leveraging our new dynamic online pricing engine and testing localized pricing for margin opportunity; building new end-to-end promotional tools and processes as well as optimizing our promotional spending and therefore, profitability; recurating our assortment to ensure we have the right price points and true value representation to better compete with mass market retailers; and evolving and modernizing our loyalty programs to better engage and retain more of our valuable customers.
Lastly, we have launched an integrated planning process for our stores and our digital platform that will tie the product and price pillars together with place and promise, creating a consistent, compelling omnichannel experience for our customers in line with our strategic intent. We are excited about this new way to create a stronger merchandising and marketing plan and look forward to sharing our progress further with you.
 
So while we're busy transforming for the future, we remain very focused on our store reopening plans and capitalizing on the momentum we have in our digital business. As an example, we have overhauled and elevated our back to college program this year, which brings to life greater ease and affordability. With 4 value-oriented and affordable options, combined with the ease and convenience of our signature College Registry and Pack & Hold services, we can help them make often stressful college transition experiences that much easier. Overall, we are very encouraged about the progress being made to rebuild our authority within the home space with our customers.
While we are in the early stages of this transformational work in merchandising, we are confident that our initiatives such as refining and elevating assortment through our customer-centric plans, strengthening a better communicating value and modernizing our online store experiences for the new omnichannel approach are the right strategies. Our teams are embracing this change and leaning into the new strategic direction with excitement.

There could be the checks from the government that are affecting the outcomes, but overall, we're seeing good patronage, good traffic and the trends staying stabilized. And what's nice against that, as those sales climb inside the stores, we're still seeing strength in our digital channel that is not changing, so a nice mix there and also a transfer to a greater merchandise mix rather than waiting into that early COVID period in essential.

Thanks, Curt. So again, as we outlined, we'll take the last bit first. The owned brand piece of it will really materialize into a Q1 onwards event that will really add value to our overall gross margin mix. We have been, as you said, very active in a number of buckets, and we didn't [indiscernible] but we are giving kind of an aggregate there, which is quite substantial on an annualized basis that will be taken in SG&A. So we are and have negotiated substantial savings in our COGS line. We're refashioning our assortment to lean into owned brands, which will have a supplementary benefit to margin. We are transforming our IT and general infrastructure costs with great savings. We are going to look at the store rationalization program, which will add dollars to the EBITDA line. And we were fortunate enough to -- in February 28, to already embark on a very strong $85 million cost reduction, which was fortuitous ahead of the COVID moment.

So I think as Mark had mentioned, price is 1 of the 5 key pillars that we're focused on. So when you think about price and promo, that all comes together under value. Value is important to our customers, and it's something we've taking very seriously. As a new management team, we're spending a lot of time talking about this and evaluating it and formalizing our strategy so we can evolve it.
Coupon, as you well know, is a big part of our mix today, but we're doing work on baseline pricing, like we launched dynamic pricing late last year. I think you've seen some more competitive price gaps to market over the last 6 months, which is something we wanted to effect, and we'll continue to evaluate more categories that we would look to put into dynamic pricing. 
But overall, pricing is -- pricing and promo is something we're -- again, we're spending a lot of time on, and it's come into play in a few different ways. One, we're establishing category roles where we want to better guide our pricing strategies, so we are more focused on where we want to make price investments. Two, we're activating thorough line reviews where we can affect pricing in conjunction with supplier discussions. We're using owned brands, and we will be more proactively in the future to address opening price points and good price points. And then we're also looking at new promotional tools to optimize promotions so that we can make sure when we do invest in promotions, that promotional spend is very effective and efficient. So -- and then lastly, I would say, over the long term, right, we are studying new ways to, again, evolve our loyalty programs because we think that there's new ways and more important ways to retain our customers.

And the program that John is leading is going to be focused on value creation, and as he said, there may be some lost revenue but certainly a pickup on profitability.

I realize you're not putting a lot of math around it, but based on your answers to the prior question, it sounds like that you may be assuming a higher sales transfer rate. Mark, I appreciate you made the apples to oranges. This is a tricky moment in time, and I do think this moment suggests that maybe more can be retained digitally than ever before.

So I'm not going to get specific, but look, I mean, yes, it's in the realm. I think you've got -- we're looking at 2019 numbers, and clearly, 2020 is going to be a different ballgame in the end of the play. What we see is a slightly different issue to a lot of our competitors because we've been able to establish market density overlap and therefore, duplication of the market. So we've got maybe 2 stores addressing 1 market that we could actually collapse higher level sales into. We've done the algorithmic math on this very, very carefully. We will see some sales degradation. We'll see some move into digital. We'll see some transfer. But the net-net of what we will achieve will be a really strong positive to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA, and then we can set about filling in some of the market-based gaps that we see maybe with a different format store or repositioning some of our fleet to really address the total market buys and scope. So it's a reframe and then reshape, but at the heart of it is the net-net benefit to EBITDA along the way. Again, we'll map out that in a sequential by-year impact. Some of it will begin in Q4 of 2020, but the majority of it will be over the next 2 years.

This was in the pre-COVID days. And we're very pleased we did, and we really monitor whether we should proceed and how we should proceed. And we've launched back to college early. It sets up in stores over the full month of July and a little bit into August, but we've been active in digital for several weeks. We are very pleased with the double-digit gains we've seen both in-store and online, and the result of both engagement conversion, sales, AUR, it's off and running.
Now it did break late as per these changes, but we, several months ago, were correlating, as John mentioned, with companies like Pinterest, and we established that people were pinning back to college ideas very early and still very relevant in the consumer line set. We've lent in here we have sharper price value. We have clear store and digital setups that's unique and aligned. We really have a very comprehensive program. It's off and running, and it's only early onset. So we see that prevailing through the rest of the quarter.

Wanted to just talk a little bit about your, I guess, promotional strategy. I know you gave a lot of color in terms of gross margin, what the headwinds were, and that was very helpful. But as I'm on your website like literally right now, I see 30% off select bedding. I see up to 50% off towels and rugs, up to 30% off bath lighting. And I just don't recall we've seen this level of promotions. So I guess my question is, first off, were increased promotions a factor at all in terms of the gross margin degradation in the first quarter. And then second off, is -- am I sort of reading into this -- too much into this? Or have you made any sort of change in terms of your promotional strategy?",Anthony Chukumba,412183080.0,,3,Analysts,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

I'll take that. So promotions will continue to be part of our marketing mix and merchandising mix, but we learned a lot about promotions over the last, I would say, 8 months. I would say we are investing, as I mentioned, in tools to make sure when we do promotions, we get a stronger lift and the investment that we make. I would say, back in March, we dialed back the promotions pretty significantly because we didn't see them working. I think we'd called it out before, and we didn't have all the right processes and tools probably to understand the elasticity of lift that we need to drive an effective promotional strategy going forward. So we're making those changes and improvements, and we'll be selecting what we do. So I wouldn't read too much into what you're seeing on the website. We will do some promotions where we need to clear out inventory and work through our resets.",Joseph Hartsig,657256051.0,,2,Executives,321778,Union,1,4,,908 688 0888,,33,650 Liberty Avenue,,,,1971,,,07083,www.bedbathandbeyond.com,1,213,37,213,43

And just actually, one sort of related follow-up. Have you come to any -- I mean, I guess, where are you in terms of the 20% off coupons?

Look, I think it's fair to say that the coupon is absolutely part of our DNA, and we want to use it more strategically and more surgically going forward. During the COVID period, we didn't lean into it as much. We actually normally have a lower rate of redemption of coupon on the digital business rather than a store-based business, and when stores closed, it was a natural outcome. But as we've opened up, as Joe has mentioned, we've pulled back on coupon. We've pulled back on promotions, and we're seeing very good business as a result. It will not disappear. It's part of who we are. We're just going to be more strategic in the management of it. As we look at our price pillar and our promise pillar, we'll be looking at the intersection between price, value, coupon and loyalty and unpacking that more with Cindy and Joe at the helm.

There's the category profits part of that, and it kind of speaks to assortment optimization reviews and supplier profitability actions. I was just curious if you could maybe expand on that.
